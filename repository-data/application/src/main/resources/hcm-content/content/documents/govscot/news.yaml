              <p>In the latest sign of progress on the A9 Dualling programme, the draft Orders and Environmental Statement confirming the line of the five mile stretch of the route between Tomatin and Moy have been published.</p>
              <p>This is the most northerly section of the A9 dualling programme and locals and road users will get a chance to see the plans at public exhibitions in Tomatin next month with more draft Orders and public exhibitions for further sections due in the next few months.</p>
              <p>Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, Keith Brown said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government is committed to dualling the A9 between Perth and Inverness by 2025, one of the biggest transport infrastructure projects in Scotland's history, and we remain on target to meet that commitment.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our ambitious programme will bring many benefits for road users, communities and businesses who live along or use this important route between central Scotland and the Highlands and Islands.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The work is continuing across the route and road users are benefiting from the new dualled stretch between Kincraig and Dalraddy which opened to traffic last year. Advance works are already underway on the next section to be dualled between Luncarty and Pass of Birnam and we expect to get construction underway in the coming months.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We published draft Orders for four sections last year and today marks a further significant milestone in our plans with draft Orders being published for the most northerly section of the A9 to be dualled between Tomatin and Moy.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We expect to publish draft orders for further dualling projects over the coming months.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I would encourage anyone with an interest in the Tomatin to Moy project to attend one of the exhibitions on 7 and 8 June or view the draft Orders and Environmental Statement online and give us their views on our proposals.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Details of the Tomatin to Moy public exhibitions:</p>
              <p>Thursday 7th June &ndash; 4.30pm - 8.00pm &ndash; Strathdearn Primary School Hall, Tomatin, IV13 7YN<br />Friday 8th June &ndash; 11.00am &ndash; 6.00pm - Strathdearn Village Hall, Tomatin, IV13 7YN</p>
              <p>Further information&nbsp;and the draft Orders are available on the<a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/projects/a9-dualling-perth-to-inverness/a9-tomatin-to-moy/a9-tomatin-to-moy/"> Tomatin-Moy</a> project page.</p>

              <p>Alternative employment and viable support for the staff of 2 Sisters Food Group and the local area are the top priorities following the announcement of the Cambuslang site&rsquo;s closure.</p>
              <p>These priorities were made clear after Business Minister, Paul Wheelhouse, chaired a meeting of partners including the Scottish Government, South Lanarkshire Council, Skills Development Scotland, Scottish Enterprise, Business Gateway, trade unions, and local elected representatives. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>Partners were updated on the work already underway, such as:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Provision of a series of two-hour long workshops to help individuals prepare CVs and to prepare for interviews</li>
              <li>A dedicated PACE Job Fair which will take place at Westburn Community Hall on May 31</li>
              <li>Identification of companies across the region, through SE Account Managers, South Lanarkshire Council, and elected members who are looking to increase headcount, with job vacancy details made available to workers at the 2 Sisters site</li>
              <li>Engagement with the site&rsquo;s owners to consider options for future use of the site</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Speaking after the meeting, which was also attended by representatives of 2 Sisters Food Group, Mr Wheelhouse said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The purpose of the roundtable was to update stakeholders on the extensive work already underway to help mitigate the impact on staff from the Cambuslang site, and the local area.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Partners have worked intensively with 2 Sisters Food Group to explore every possible option to secure a sustainable future for the site and to safeguard jobs in Cambuslang, including working with the Unite union and the UK Government.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, despite our very best efforts, the 2 Sisters Food Group could not be persuaded to retain the site and decided that closure of the site in Cambuslang could not be avoided.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There is clearly much activity already underway and I hope that the dedicated PACE Jobs Fair announced today will give reassurance and optimism to the workforce. A second consultation on the proposed redundancy programme is underway by Bernard Matthews in Norfolk which will determine the number of posts to be transferred and number of redundancies. Our focus now is on helping staff into alternative employment and ensuring the local community is fully supported.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Leader of South Lanarkshire Council John Ross said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is heartening to see so many agencies coming together with the shared aim of doing everything we can to help the people affected by this hugely regrettable closure.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is a significant blow but I know from experience how resilient local folk are, and our local economy is performing well.&nbsp; The Council will work with every willing partner to help those who have lost their jobs find new opportunities, and we will do everything we can to continue to support the local economy.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>An extra 2,000 people will be eligible for financial support to help pay for a funeral, under Scottish Government plans.</p>
              <p>Improvements to Funeral Expense Assistance will also see an annual increase to the contribution for other funeral costs as well as quicker processing times &ndash; within 10 working days.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;A public consultation is now open, seeking views on proposals including how to consider difficult family circumstances.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman said:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Arranging a funeral can be a daunting, stressful and painful process and if you are struggling financially it can make matters even worse. By extending eligibility we will reach more people who would have previously received nothing under the UK government system.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are taking action to support more people who are struggling with these costs and will invest more than &pound;3 million each year, over and above the existing funding that will be transferred from the UK Government.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We have listened carefully to the views of stakeholders and those with direct experience of the current DWP payment. I am keen to hear from as many people as possible during this consultation so we can continue to build a service that treats everyone with dignity, fairness and respect.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Around 90 pupils from local primary schools attended an event on Wednesday 16 May at Stewarts Hall in Huntly to celebrate the success of Transport Scotland&rsquo;s schools engagement programme on the A96 Dualling East of Huntly to Aberdeen scheme.</p>
              <p>The event let local school children present their projects to a judging panel from Transport Scotland&rsquo;s design consultancy AmeyArup. Prizes were awarded to the winning teams in different categories.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government is investing in and committed to ensuring Scotland has a highly educated and skilled population equipped with the Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) skills, knowledge and capability required to adapt and thrive in a fast-paced changing world and economy.</p>
              <p>As part of this commitment the A96 Dualling schools engagement programme has seen a number of teachers from local schools being trained in the necessary skills to enthuse and inspire children to enter or take an interest in the professions associated with the delivery of the A96 Dualling.&nbsp; The programme involves a series of progressive and linked exercises increasing in complexity depending on the pupils&rsquo; ages and skill levels with the emphasis on engineering, linked to real engineers and engineering projects.</p>
              <p>Keith Brown Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our ambitious A96 Dualling programme will upgrade the road between the cities of Inverness and Aberdeen to dual carriageway. However as we design and build this important new road, it is important that we bring benefits to the communities who live along it.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our schools engagement is an important part of that work and it is fitting in the Year of Young People that we are leaving a legacy for the future. By training teachers to deliver a programme for pupils in local schools we are helping them develop an interest in engineering.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The fact that engineers from Transport Scotland and the consultants designing the dualled route between East of Huntly and Aberdeen are taking the time to offer their expertise will help inspire the children to consider being the engineers of the future.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Lise McCaffery, Regional Director for Primary Engineer, expressed her delight with the project outcomes.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Primary Engineer is an organisation working to promote engineering skills and careers with young people across Scotland. We are delighted to have partnered with Transport Scotland to deliver our programmes with teachers and pupils in Aberdeenshire for the first time and their enjoyment in the projects are evident here today.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The Scottish Government has put forward two proposals to ensure the bill respects devolution &ndash; remove the legislative constraint on the Parliament and proceed on the basis of mutual trust, or amend the bill so the Parliament&rsquo;s consent is required before any orders restricting its powers are made. It is now incumbent on the UK Government to amend the bill in line with the principles of devolution.</p>
              <p>Mr Russell said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Parliament made it explicitly clear that the current EU Withdrawal Bill as it stands is not acceptable. It must now not be imposed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In accordance with the motion agreed in the vote, I call on the UK Government to come to Scotland and hear the concerns from across the Parliament, and to amend the bill.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government and Parliament have already set out a clear way forward &ndash; either remove the legislative constraint and proceed on the basis of mutual trust, or amend the bill so the Parliament&rsquo;s consent is required before any orders are made.&nbsp; The ball is in the UK Government&rsquo;s court.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The UK Government are asking the Scottish Parliament to trust that they will not take powers without our consent, yet if they fail to amend this bill after Parliament has refused consent they will have demonstrated exactly why the current proposals cannot be approved.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The clock is ticking and we need urgent action that respects the position of the Scottish Parliament and the devolution settlement the people of Scotland voted for.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The amount of organic farmland in Scotland has slightly increased in 2017, the first increase since 2008. A total of 123,000 hectares was certified as organic farmland in Scotland. Organic land now accounts for two per cent of agricultural land in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2018/05/3038">new figures</a> on organic farming were published today by analysts in the Scottish Government. Grass and rough grazing, used for producing beef, lamb or milk, makes up 93 per cent of organic land, with cereals accounting for a further four per cent.</p>
              <p>The number of organic cattle remained fairly constant at about 29,000, but there was a significant increase in the number of sheep, up by one third to 154,000. About two per cent of both cattle and sheep are organic.</p>
              <p>There was also another increase in the number of licensed producers and processors, up from 560 in 2016 to 578 in 2016, of which 371 were producers.</p>
              <p>There was also an increase in the area of organic farmland in the UK as a whole, with three per cent of agricultural land now organic. In Europe, organic production has been consistently increasing, with the latest available data, for 2016, showing just under seven per cent of agricultural land used for organic farming.</p>
              <p>The documents released today were produced by independent statistical staff, free from any political interference, in accordance with professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>

              <p>Children of EU citizens residing in the UK should be exempt from paying any registration costs after the Brexit negotiations conclude, External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop said.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government is calling for the UK Government to commit to not impose post-Brexit registration fees for the 35,000 children of EU families under the age of 16 currently living in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Speaking ahead of the &lsquo;World Congress on Migration, Ethnicity, Race and Health&rsquo; in Edinburgh, Ms Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland has always been an outward looking nation, embracing the world beyond our borders. That spirit continues today: Scots voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and they will continue to welcome people to live, work and study in our country.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We believe the current UK Government&rsquo;s hostile immigration policy and unrealistic migration targets are hindering Scotland&rsquo;s economic growth and our wider wellbeing.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want the UK Government to commit to not impose any fee in relation to the settled status process. Failing that, we ask at least for an exemption for all children living in the UK &ndash; many who were born here, consider themselves Scots and may be legally entitled to British citizenship. Concerns about costs will be an issue for many families and the UK Government should act now.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As set out in our recently published paper, we believe Scotland should be granted devolved powers on migration, which would allow us to improve the rights of the migrants &ndash; and their families &ndash; living here, while benefiting our country&rsquo;s economy and demography.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We urge the new Home Secretary to act to make the system more humane and recognise the benefits of migration in Scotland and across the UK. I look forward to discussing these matters with Mr Javid in the near future.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong><strong>Background </strong></strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Of the 219,000 EU citizens currently in Scotland, approximately 35,000 or around one in six (16.1%), are aged 0-16.</li>
              <li>The Scottish Government has published a discussion paper on <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-population-needs-migration-policy/">Scotland&rsquo;s Population Needs &amp; Migration Policy</a>.</li>

              <p>Plans unveiled today for a&nbsp;new road in Inverness linking the A9 and A96 trunk roads will provide enhanced facilities for road users, cyclists and pedestrians.</p>
              <p>These include a 3 metre shared surface on both sides of the carriageway and a dedicated cycleway and separate footway linking to Inverness Retail and Business Park.&nbsp;The cycling and pedestrian facilities will also connect into the existing core path, local path and national cycle networks.</p>
              <p>At the same time, a decision has been taken to progress an option to the east of Ashton Farm (Variant B) as part of the preferred option identified late last year.</p>
              <p>The plans for the A9/A96 Inshes to Smithton scheme are available for locals and road users to see at drop-ins being held in Raigmore today and Smithton tomorrow.&nbsp; Visitors can find out more about the developing design as we look to publish draft Orders next year.</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment within the &pound;315 million Inverness and Highland City-Region Deal, we are progressing our plans for a single carriageway road connecting Inshes and Smithton in the Highland capital.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Since we identified the preferred option for the scheme late last year, our design consultants have been considering all the feedback received.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are now able to let locals and road users see and comment on the updated proposals including our exciting plans for enhanced provision for cyclists and pedestrians and the preferred route option with variant B confirmed as the line of the scheme to be taken forward.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I would encourage anyone with an interest to come along to one of the venues to view our plans and to have an opportunity to discuss them with our team and provide vital feedback. The material shown at the drop-in sessions is also be available on the project page on the Transport Scotland website.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Details of the public exhibitions:</p>

              <p>The training focuses on offering support to people who are planning a funeral and 80% of Citizens Advice Bureaux across Scotland now have advisors who are fully trained.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government funded Planning for Funerals course is also available to all third sector organisations and others who may be interested on the Child Poverty Action Group website.</p>
              <p>Cabinet Secretary for Social Security Angela Constance visited West Lothian Citizens Advice Bureau today to meet newly trained staff members and volunteers who provide support.</p>
              <p>She said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is Good Death Week, which is a chance for people to be more open about death and planning for their funerals. It&rsquo;s an opportunity for communities to come together and discuss these important issues and for people who are struggling with bereavement to learn about the support that&rsquo;s available.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;One of the reasons we funded this training was to enable Citizens Advice Bureaux advisers to provide support to people who wanted to start planning their own funeral or needed help planning a funeral for a loved one.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;For anyone who is struggling to pay for a funeral, their local CAB can help them apply for a Funeral Expenses Payment &ndash; a benefit which is due to be devolved and delivered by the Scottish Government from next year.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are also continuing to work closely with the funeral industry, local authorities and the third sector to tackle the costs of funerals and have developed our Funeral Costs Plan to help people manage funeral costs.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Karen Nailen, CEO of Citizens Advice Bureau West Lothian, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our advisers here often see members of the public who are unable to afford the cost of a funeral for a loved one. Like CABs across the country we provide all the support we can, but it is obviously a really distressing situation for anyone to be in.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we are backing this call for people to plan ahead for their funeral, so your loved ones can say goodbye properly and as painlessly as possible. As ever, your local CAB can give you free, confidential and independent advice.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;The Scottish Government funded Planning For Funerals module is on the<strong> <a href="http://elearning.cpag.org.uk/enrol/index.php?id=27">CPAG website</a>.</strong></p>
              <p>The Scottish Government has also published the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2017/08/4930">Planning Your Own Funeral leaflet</a>.</p>

              <p>The Scottish Government will continue to support and invest in the rural economy despite Brexit, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said at the 20<sup>th</sup> National Economic Forum in Dumfries.</p>
              <p>With 97% of Scotland&rsquo;s land mass classed as rural, the theme of the forum is &lsquo;driving forward the rural economy&rsquo;.</p>
              <p>Steps by the Scottish Government to support the rural economy include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Establishing the Scottish Rural Parliament</li>
              <li>Appointing a Council of Rural Advisers</li>
              <li>Establishing a south of Scotland Enterprise Agency&nbsp;&nbsp; by 2020, and setting up the South of Scotland Economic Partnership</li>
              <li>Committing to publish proposals on ensuring a smooth transition in farming support as the UK leaves the EU</li>
              <li>Dualling the A9 and A96 and investing &pound;35 million in the Maybole bypass between Stranraer and Ayr</li>
              <li>Implementing the Digital Scotland Superfast Broadband scheme</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In many of the sectors that our economic future depends, rural communities make a massive contribution. So ensuring rural Scotland thrives is a fundamental part of ensuring our economy thrives.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland &ndash; including rural Scotland &ndash; has huge economic strengths and potential. Brexit makes it more important than ever that we build on those, which is why we must ensure the specific consequences of Brexit for rural communities are identified and addressed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;By investing in innovation and infrastructure and providing the right support for business we can help rural Scotland to build on its strengths, overcome challenges such as Brexit and seize new opportunities.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The importance of recognising rural needs is also why we are establishing a new south of Scotland Enterprise Agency. And ahead of it being establishing, we have set up the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, backed by &pound;10 million of additional funding.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;All of these steps will support the rural economy, and in turn drive Scotland forward.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Thousands of parents will no longer have to pay expensive upfront childcare deposits under a pilot scheme.</p>
              <p>Families who use either a childminder or nursery before their children become eligible for publicly-funded childcare, usually at age three, can be asked to pay a deposit of as much as &pound;900.</p>
              <p>In Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dumfries and Galloway, the Scottish Government will cover that cost for eligible families until December 2019 through a deposit guarantee. Almost half (44%) of parents in the pilot areas with a child under two who are taking up childcare for the first time can benefit from the scheme.</p>
              <p>Childcare Minister Maree Todd announced the pilot during a visit to North Edinburgh Childcare.</p>
              <p>Ms Todd said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As well as giving every child the best start in life, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s plans to almost double funded early learning and childcare will save families an average of &pound;4,500 per child per year by 2020.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This deposit guarantee trial will benefit parents - especially those returning to work or training - who often face crippling upfront costs to access childcare before their funded entitlement kicks in. We will work closely with NHS Health Scotland to evaluate its impact to inform any future decisions on national roll-out.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Karen Williams works at North Edinburgh Childcare, where her two children attended nursery. She said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The deposit guarantee scheme would have made a big difference to my family &ndash; we found it difficult to afford the upfront costs when my baby started nursery, as we had to pay both a deposit and upfront fees.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Free early learning and childcare is available to all three and four-year-olds and eligible two-year-olds.</p>
              <p>Early Years Scotland will <a href="http://dgs.earlyyearsscotland.org/"><strong>deliver the pilot</strong></a> and the Scottish Government will work closely with NHS Health Scotland to evaluate it.</p>
              <p>The scheme will be open to those in pilot areas in receipt of tax credits or Universal Credit with a child aged 0-2 who is taking up an early learning and childcare place for the first time, approximately 44% of families with a child aged 0-2.</p>
              <p>Further details can be found on the website that has been developed for families and providers here: <a href="http://dgs.earlyyearsscotland.org/">http://dgs.earlyyearsscotland.org/</a></p>

              <p>Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe Michael Russell has urged the UK Government to remove the parts of the EU Withdrawal Bill that constrain devolved powers, following a vote in the Scottish Parliament.</p>
              <p>Mr Russell said the decision of the Parliament to withhold consent from the withdrawal bill means it must now be adjusted to respect the vote.</p>
              <p>The current bill will allow the UK Government to prevent the Scottish Parliament from legislating in key devolved areas, such as agriculture, fisheries and the environment, for up to seven years without the consent of the parliament.</p>
              <p>He said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In line with the clear majority of people in Scotland, we don&rsquo;t want to leave the EU and we are still working to find a way to secure as much as we can from our present relationship. But we accept that legal preparation for Brexit is required.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;However, the UK Government wants to take a power to restrict the competence of this Parliament.&nbsp; And it wants to be able to exercise this power even in the face of an explicit decision by this Parliament that it should not.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Parliament has now said overwhelmingly that this attempt to undermine devolution is unacceptable.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The UK Government cannot ignore the reality of devolution or try to drown out what this Parliament says. They cannot pretend that no motion has been passed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;If they now move to force on this Parliament an arrangement for restricting devolution that does not have Parliament&rsquo;s consent they will do so in the full knowledge that they are breaking the twenty year old devolution settlement and operating out with the agreed constitution.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The solution, as this Parliament has agreed, is straightforward. That is for the UK Government to remove the clause that fundamentally undermines devolution and to proceed on the basis of agreement.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The UK Government must respect the will of the Parliament.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The legislative consent convention, that the Westminster Parliament will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the devolved parliament, is a constitutional convention, that is a non-legal constitutional constraint.&nbsp; The convention protects the role and responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government within the UK&rsquo;s overall governance system.&nbsp; The Scottish Parliament motion confirms that legislative consent will not be given to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill as it currently stands. Under the convention, the UK Government should not now proceed with the elements of the Bill for which legislative consent of the Parliament is required.</p>

              <p>Around 90 pupils from 10 local primary schools attended an event today in the Inverness Leisure Centre to celebrate the success of Transport Scotland&rsquo;s schools engagement programme on the A96 Dualling Inverness to Nairn (including Nairn Bypass) scheme.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government is investing in and committed to ensuring Scotland has a highly educated and skilled population equipped with the Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM)&nbsp;skills, knowledge and capability required to adapt and thrive in a fast-paced changing world and economy.</p>
              <p>As part of this commitment the A96 Dualling schools engagement programme has seen a number of teachers from local schools being trained in the necessary skills to enthuse and inspire children to enter or take an interest in the professions associated with the delivery of the A96 Dualling. &nbsp;The programme involves a series of progressive and linked exercises increasing in complexity depending on the pupils&rsquo; ages and skill levels with the emphasis on engineering, linked to real engineers and engineering projects.</p>
              <p>Today&rsquo;s event let local school children present their projects to a judging panel from Transport Scotland&rsquo;s design consultants Jacobs UK Ltd. Prizes were awarded to the winning teams in different categories. Building on the success of last year&rsquo;s schools engagement, this year&rsquo;s programme saw 23 teachers and their classes taking part in a project to design a car model. Training has been delivered to primary school teachers by specialist educational supplier Primary Engineer. Engineers from Jacobs UK Ltd have assisted with presentations, Q&amp;A sessions and class projects.</p>
              <p>Keith Brown Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work said: &nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As well as upgrading the A96 between Inverness and Aberdeen to dual carriageway, this Government recognises the importance of benefitting the communities who live along the route as we design and build the new road. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is fitting in the Year of Young People that our schools engagement is leaving a legacy for the future, training teachers to deliver a programme for pupils in local schools which helps them develop an interest in engineering. This year it is very encouraging that the team has reached around 540 local school children, more than double the number reached last year, with presentations, mentoring and participation in the car model projects.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The fact that engineers from Transport Scotland and the design consultants working on the A96 Dualling Programme are taking the time to offer their expertise will help inspire the children to consider being the engineers of the future.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Lise McCaffery, Regional Director for Primary Engineer, expressed her delight with the project outcomes.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Primary Engineer is an organisation working to promote engineering skills and careers with young people across Scotland. We are delighted to have partnered with Transport Scotland in our second year of delivery of programmes with Highland schools and see the impact its making.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Young people are being encouraged to join the biggest conversation Scotland has ever had on mental health stigma and discrimination.</p>
              <p>As part of the Year of Young People 2018, the Scottish Government and See Me, the national programme to tackle mental health stigma and discrimination, are working alongside young people to create a new campaign for eight to 26 year olds.</p>
              <p>Young people are being surveyed to share their views on the mental health issues they face, including if they are able to talk about their feelings and if they could help someone who was struggling.</p>
              <p><em><br /> </em>See Me volunteer and university student Rebecca Johnson, 22, from Glasgow, first started experiencing anxiety and panic attacks when she was at school, after developing an intense fear of change. However, when she tried to speak about what she was going through she found people didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
              <p>Rebecca said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;People didn&rsquo;t understand why I stopped going out or why I wasn&rsquo;t the same. They just put it down to me being a bad friend. Even when I tried to explain they didn&rsquo;t understand. From my experience, I don&rsquo;t think young people are taken seriously when it comes to mental health.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I was 16 when I first reached out for help and the reaction I got from the doctor was awful. I was told I was just stuck in a routine and playing everything up in my head. She told me I shouldn&rsquo;t book another doctor&rsquo;s appointment, just changing my routine and exercising more would fix it.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The whole thing made dealing with life more difficult than it needed to be. But what was positive was that I decided if the help wasn&rsquo;t there then I could be that help. So I am now studding psychology as I want to be a child psychologist.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Speaking during Mental Health Awareness Week, Mental Health Minister Maureen Watt said the campaign will draw on the survey&rsquo;s research.</p>
              <p>Ms Watt said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Year of Young People 2018 is about giving young people a stronger voice and we have been told loudly and clearly that they want greater attention given to mental health and wellbeing. We have listened, and this will be the biggest conversation on mental health stigma and discrimination young people in Scotland have ever had.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Young people can contribute in ways that suit them, especially those less likely to engage in person. More and more people are recognising the importance of caring for our mental health as we would our physical health, and we want everyone to have their say.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Calum Irving, See Me director, added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want to create the biggest conversation young people in Scotland have ever had on mental health stigma and discrimination. Young people have already told us that it is okay not to be okay. We want to go further and find out why young people aren&rsquo;t always okay.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want to understand what gets in the way of seeking help so we can end the stigma. Only then will all young people feel confident to speak about how they feel, without the fear of being judged or dismissed.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Public exhibitions are being held on 29 and 30 May in Inverness to let locals and road users view and comment on the options being developed for the Longman Junction Improvement scheme.</p>
              <p>The proposals can be viewed at Inverness Town House on 29 May and Inverness Caledonian Thistle&rsquo;s stadium on 30 May 2018.</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment within the &pound;315 million Inverness and Highland City-Region Deal, significant investment will be made in the trunk road network to deliver the grade separation of the A9/A82 Longman junction and the A9/A96 Inshes to Smithton Link Road to improve congestion and accessibility to Inverness.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Improving the traffic bottleneck at Longman is a key priority of the Scottish Government and we have been working hard to develop possible options for this important junction and we can now let the public see and comment on a series of options.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I would encourage anyone with an interest to come along to one of the venues on 29 or 30 May to view our plans and to have an opportunity to discuss them with our team and provide comments. The vital feedback received will then be taken into account as we look to identify a preferred option early next year.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The interests of children will be at the heart of family justice modernisation proposals, ministers have pledged.</p>
              <p>The role of the courts in cases involving children of separated parents and the law around parental responsibilities and rights will be considered as part of a consultation on key themes to be included in a family justice modernisation strategy.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government is seeking the public&rsquo;s views on issues including:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>How the court obtains the views of the child in family cases</li>
              <li>Protection of victims of domestic abuse and their children during family court proceedings</li>
              <li>Regulation of child contact centres and of child welfare reporters who advise sheriffs and judges in family court cases</li>
              <li>How children can maintain relationships with key adults in their lives</li>
              <li>Alternatives to court such as family mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution</li>
              <li>Aspects of the Children&rsquo;s Hearing&rsquo;s system, which aims to ensure the safety and wellbeing of vulnerable children and young people</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The consultation will also ask for opinions about changes to the law to prevent direct cross-examination of victims of domestic abuse by their alleged abusers in child contact cases before the civil courts.</p>
              <p>Legal Affairs Minister Annabelle Ewing said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We know that family breakdown can be very upsetting for children and it is our responsibility to ensure that the family justice system is supportive and does not contribute to their distress. That means putting the best interests of the child first in every case and feedback from this consultation will help us to identify where changes are needed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The often sensitive issues involved can give rise to competing viewpoints, and that is why we are looking for as wide a range of responses as possible to help shape the future of family law in Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In this Year of Young People I am particularly keen to hear the views and first-hand experiences of children and young people and we have produced child-friendly questions to encourage them to get involved.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>As part of improving how family cases are dealt with by the courts, the Scottish Government committed in Programme for Government to consulting on a review of the provisions of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 on parental responsibilities and rights and contact and residence cases involving children, with the goal of placing children and young people at the centre of family court cases.</p>
              <p>The Programme for Government also set out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s intention to consult on changes to the law to prevent cross-examination of victims of domestic abuse by their alleged abusers in child contact cases.</p>

              <p>Scotland will aim to halve childhood obesity by 2030, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government will set the target in its Healthy Weight and Diet plan, due to be published in summer 2018. Currently, 29% of children in Scotland are at risk of being overweight, including 14% who are at risk of being obese. Nine out of ten people believe obesity is a serious problem in the country. Responses to a recent public consultation on the diet and healthy weight plan showed strong support for the government restricting marketing of unhealthy food.</p>
              <p>The First Minister announced the commitment while meeting campaigner and chef Jamie Oliver to discuss joint action to tackle child obesity and unhealthy eating.</p>
              <p>The First Minister said: &ldquo;Obesity is a serious public health issue which cannot be ignored. Evidence shows obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and become more likely to suffer health problems such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our guiding ambition is to halve child obesity in Scotland by 2030 and we&rsquo;ll outline in our forthcoming Healthy Weight plan how we will develop the necessary actions to achieve this, and help everybody make healthy choices about food.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As part of this, we will tackle junk food promotions and the marketing of unhealthy food, such as multi-buys, that encourage overconsumption. To ensure that the steps we take are proportionate and deliver beneficial outcomes, we will consult widely with consumers, suppliers and retailers following the release of the new plan.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Diet and activity go together and our Healthy Weight plan will build on programmes like Scotland&rsquo;s Daily Mile that encourage children to be more active, by helping them to improve diet as well and to ensure our younger generations can live fit, healthy and active lives.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Jamie Oliver said: &ldquo;First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has shown she cares about the health of Scotland's kids by committing to halving childhood obesity in the next 12 years. We look forward to seeing her strong multi-layered strategy.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Professor Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK&rsquo;s cancer prevention expert said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic that the Scottish Government has reinforced its commitment to tackling Scotland&rsquo;s obesity crisis. With so many people carrying too much weight, it&rsquo;s clear bold action is needed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Obesity is the biggest cause of cancer after smoking and is responsible for around 2,200 cases a year in Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Price promotions play a significant part in what families choose to put into their shopping basket. In the battle to protect the health of future generations, it&rsquo;s crucial laws are introduced to restrict the damaging supermarket junk food price promotions that are contributing to the nation&rsquo;s obesity problem.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Analysis of responses to public consultation on the diet and healthy weight delivery plan can be found on the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2018/04/3768">Scottish Government website</a>.</p>
              <p>Nine out of ten people in Scotland think obesity is a serious problem in the country, and 82% believe reducing obesity is a shared responsibility (<a href="http://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/publications-and-research/the-scottish-diet-it-needs-to-change-2018-update">The Scottish Diet - It needs to change 2018 update</a>, Food Standards Scotland, 2018).</p>

              <p>Career changers are being targeted in a new campaign to recruit more childcare staff.</p>
              <p>Families across Scotland are set to benefit from an almost doubling of funded early years and childcare provision by 2020.</p>
              <p>To expand the workforce, the Scottish Government is creating almost 2,000 more training places at university and college this year alone, and supporting a substantial increase in the number of modern apprenticeships.</p>
              <p>The &lsquo;A Job and A Joy&rsquo; campaign emphasises the rewarding, enjoyable and meaningful nature of a job in childcare.</p>
              <p>Childcare Minister Maree Todd said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We know that when people consider changing career they want to achieve a good work life balance and do rewarding and meaningful work. A career in childcare does exactly that.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our expansion of funded nursery education and childcare will create thousands of high quality and well-paid jobs across Scotland. Working with children is rewarding, enjoyable and meaningful, and this is the focus of our &lsquo;A Job and A Joy&rsquo; campaign. I urge those thinking of changing jobs to seriously consider a career in childcare.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Nicola Johnstone, nursery practitioner at Country Bumpkins Nursery in Inverness-shire said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I recently changed my job from being a hairdresser to working in a nursery and I absolutely love it. It&rsquo;s such a rewarding role. Seeing children&rsquo;s happy faces makes you feel happy and there&rsquo;s a real sense of achievement.&nbsp; I enjoy being part of a team and there&rsquo;s lots of creativity, no two days are the same.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Country Bumpkins Nursery manager, Nicola Bartlett, commented:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have a number of people who have changed careers and moved into Childcare here at the nursery.&nbsp; I think the fact that it&rsquo;s a fun and varied job makes it attractive, and that you&rsquo;re really making a difference to the children&rsquo;s lives so it&rsquo;s also very rewarding.&nbsp; At our nursery we like to spend lots of time outdoors and on the nearby beach.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re currently developing an outdoor classroom too, so children can choose to spend the day inside or outside.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Households renting in the private and social sector have been severely affected by UK Government welfare policies, a new report shows.</p>
              <p>The Impact of UK Welfare Policy on Housing report highlights the negative effect of Universal Credit on both tenants and landlords, due to the major increase in rent arrears. In East Lothian for example, 72% of social housing tenants claiming Universal Credit were in arrears, compared to 30% of all tenants.</p>
              <p>In addition, the UK Government&rsquo;s freeze on local housing allowance rates &ndash; a benefit paid to private rental tenants &nbsp;&ndash; has also substantially limited households ability to afford rent on properties.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government funds the full mitigation of the bedroom tax, which would otherwise affect over 70,000 individuals who would lose an average of around &pound;650 a year, as well as providing additional funding for direct mitigation of welfare reforms, wider direct support for those on low incomes and advice and other services.</p>
              <p>Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Almost half a million Scottish households receive some form of financial support for their housing. It is clear that UK Government welfare cuts are having a devastating impact, with money taken from the pockets of people across the country, pushing them into crisis and debt.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are doing all we can, with the powers we have to protect those on low incomes from these devastating UK Government cuts - spending more than &pound;125 million this year alone to do so. This includes &pound;62 million to fully mitigate the &lsquo;bedroom tax&rsquo;, help for those impacted by the freeze in local housing allowance, as well as providing support for low-income households.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This report builds on previously published evidence of the undue pressure on people that UK government changes to our welfare system are causing, including housing. We want to ensure everyone has access to a safe, warm place to call home &ndash; as part of that, the UK Government must urgently change course.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p><a href="https://cdn.prgloo.com/media/dfa6e476060441c3b7d303de52401b8c.pdf">The Impact of UK Welfare Policy on Housing report</a>&nbsp;is the third in a series of reports looking at the impact of UK welfare reforms. <a href="https://news.gov.scot/news/impact-of-uk-government-welfare-cuts">The first report</a> focused on the impact on families, and <a href="https://news.gov.scot/news/uk-government-welfare-cuts">the second report</a> on the impact on disabled people.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>In the private sector there are limits in the maximum housing benefit payable against rent, set in relation to household size and local market rents &ndash; the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rates. The LHA rate was reduced as part of the coalition government welfare reform, to the 30<sup>th</sup> percentile of market rents, and has remained frozen since 2015.</p>

              <p>A review into the &pound;160 million in CAP funding owed to Scottish hill farmers is to be delayed.</p>
              <p>Despite agreeing to conduct a review following pressure from the Scottish Government, the UK Government has now written to Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing informing of the open ended delay.</p>
              <p>Under the last CAP reform, the EU set out to redistribute direct payments more equally based on average Euros per hectare. The UK only qualified for a &pound;190 million uplift because Scotland&rsquo;s low payment rate per hectare, which brought the UK below the qualifying threshold. To date, the UK Government has only allocated around &pound;30 million to Scotland, with the rest being distributed across the UK, despite the money being earned in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Mr Ewing said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This delay is completely unacceptable. Scottish hill farmers are owed &pound;160 million, which the UK Government has repeatedly ignored. I have been clear throughout that the money was earned in Scotland, and quite frankly should be returned to Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our demand for the monies to be returned to Scotland is not against farmers in other parts of the UK, but is about setting a precedent for future agricultural funding within the UK. The lack of progress on this long-standing unresolved issue is disappointing, particularly at a time when we are about to enter a range of complex and critical future funding discussions with the UK Government.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Having already secured the review and agreed its independent chair, it is disappointing to learn that the review is being kicked into the long grass.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The EU Multi Annual Financial Framework set out the aim of redistributing CAP payments more equitably across the EU based on average &euro;/hectare. Under the framework, all countries receiving less than 90% of the EU average would receive a funding uplift. As the Member State, the UK only qualified for an uplift because of Scotland, whose per hectare rate is only 45% of the EU average. England, Wales and Northern Ireland are all above the 90% qualifying threshold.</p>

              <p>The Scottish Government has invited Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) to apply for European Regional Development Funding (ERDF) to establish a multi-million pound Challenge Fund to protect and promote the Highlands &amp; Islands natural and cultural heritage assets.</p>
              <p>The fund will support the sustainable development of the rich and varied natural and cultural assets in the Highlands &amp; Islands, targeting the more rural parts of the region. It will bring sustainable and lasting local economic and social benefits, including increased visitor numbers and spend.</p>
              <p>Welcoming SNH&rsquo;s application at Ardvreck Castle, as part of a visit to Tongue and the Northern Highlands, Tourism Secretary Fiona Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Tourism is a crucial element of the Highlands &amp; Islands economy and it contributes to shaping the innovative offerings throughout the region &ndash; some of which I had the chance to experience first-hand during this visit.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Having visited communities whose local economies are so significantly linked to tourism, it is reassuring to hear that this this fund will target those heritage assets in the more remote and rural parts of Scotland, bringing considerable social and economic benefits.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government will continue to do all we can to support sustainable growth in tourism, working in partnership with local communities &ndash; in Assynt, throughout the Highlands &amp; Islands and across Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Mike Cantlay, SNH Chair, said: &ldquo;A key priority for SNH is to help ensure tourism and other sectors benefit from, and invest in, Scotland&rsquo;s high quality environment, and that's why we're particularly delighted to be considered to lead this new fund.</p>
              <p>"Nature and culture are closely linked in the Highlands &amp; Islands, and in many places they are central to the local economy, maintaining rural populations, jobs and skills. We want to make the most of new opportunities to spread those benefits to more rural communities in the coming years. We look forward to taking the next steps when we meet with stakeholders later this month.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>The Scottish Government is the Managing Authority for the ERDF programme in Scotland and is responsible for the implementation, management and effectiveness of funds distributed through the programmes.</li>
              <li>SNH have submitted an application to Scottish Government (as Managing Authority for the ERDF Programme) and this is currently being progressed through the assessment process.</li>
              <li>Further details are available on <a href="https://www.nature.scot/">SNH website</a>.</li>

              <p>Experts from retail, the waste and chemical industries, the public sector and academia have joined a Scottish Government panel tackling plastic pollution.</p>
              <p>The government has also appointed current Electoral Commissioner Dame Sue Bruce as chair of the Expert Panel on Environmental Charges and Other Measures, a group that will provide advice on dealing with disposable cups and plastic straws.</p>
              <p>She will be joined by behavioural expert Professor Dame Theresa Marteau, economist Professor Liam Delaney, Mike Barry, the director of sustainable business at Marks &amp; Spencer, Roger Kilburn from the biotech and chemical industry, Professor Margaret Bates from the waste industry and Professor Aileen McHarg who will bring legal expertise.</p>
              <p>SEPA chief executive Terry A'Hearn, Zero Waste Scotland chief executive Iain Gulland and disability adviser Professor Kate Sang will also sit on the group. A 2050 Climate Group representative will provide a young person&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
              <p>Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland has demonstrated leadership in tackling plastic pollution. We were the first country in the UK to commit to introducing a deposit return scheme and we are currently consulting on proposals to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds, one of the items most commonly found on our beaches.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;But I want to go further, and the creation of our expert panel &nbsp;is an important step towards seriously addressing this issue in Scotland. The panel&rsquo;s expertise and skills from across waste, legal, retail and public sectors as well providing a voice for young people and disabled people, will help us identify the bold actions we can take in Scotland to encourage long-term, sustainable changes in consumer and producer behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Dame Sue Bruce said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am very much looking forward to working with the Expert Panel in this important and fascinating work. Not one of us can have failed to be shocked by the coverage in recent months of the state of plastic pollution on our land and in our seas.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;While these might be global issues, action can be taken by all of us much closer to home.&nbsp; The panel will be asking questions about what we can do together in Scotland - as consumers, communities, producers, retailers and government &ndash; to radically change our attitudes and our use of single-use items.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Dame Susan Bruce was appointed Electoral Commissioner in 2017. She is the former Chief Executive of The City of Edinburgh Council, Aberdeen City Council and East Dunbartonshire Council and has non-executive roles in the charitable, higher education and commercial sectors.</p>
              <p>Announced in the 2017/18 Programme for Government, the Expert Panel on Environmental Charging and Other Measures is an advisory group being established to provide advice to Scottish Ministers on charges or other measures which may be adopted in Scotland within devolved competence with the goal of encouraging the long-term and sustainable changes in consumer and producer behaviour required to move to a circular economy.&nbsp; To fulfil this remit, the group will have an initial working life of two years, over which time it will deliver a rolling programme of</p>

              <p>Nurses in the Highlands and Islands can become fully qualified midwives in just 20 months, through a new &pound;500,000 pilot scheme.</p>
              <p>The shortened midwifery programme will be available to local registered adult nurses, and those from further afield who wish to study at the University of Highlands and Islands and then work in the region. It&rsquo;s being delivered in conjunction with NHS Highland and NHS Western Isles.</p>
              <p>The programme will start in January 2019 and run for 20 months. The Scottish Government will fund tuition fees for 20 students, provide bursary support for those currently not in employment &ndash; about &pound;6,500 per student &ndash; and, along with the NHS Boards, fund salary costs of existing employees undertaking the training.</p>
              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are taking action to widen access to midwifery and this pilot programme will allow nurses &ndash; both living in the Western Isles and Highlands and Islands and those who live elsewhere but wish to work in the region &ndash; to become registered midwives faster than the standard courses currently on offer. I hope as a result of this, more nurses will consider a career in midwifery where there will be more posts available.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Applications are now open and I would encourage those who have considered training to become a midwife in the past but haven&rsquo;t pursued it to apply.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Mary Burnside head of midwifery for NHS Highland said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;NHS Highland welcomes the support of the Scottish Government to this exciting new initiative which will open up career options for nurses who are committed to working and living in Highland area.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;NHS Highland values the collaborative working with the University of the Highlands and Islands which is strengthening access to career opportunities for nurses and midwives at a local level.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Professor Crichton Lang, deputy principal of the university and head of the School of Health, Social Care and Life Sciences, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are delighted to be playing a key role in this innovative development which will strengthen the supply of qualified midwives, enhance career opportunities and help to meet the needs of our local communities. The programme will be part of our growing portfolio of teaching and research in in allied health and social care, sport and wellbeing, rural health and biomedical science.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Chris Anne Campbell, Nurse Director, NHS Western Isles said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;NHS Western Isles welcomes this exciting new initiative that offers opportunities for qualified nurses to advance their careers further and for newly qualified nurses to complete their midwifery training within 20 months.&nbsp; This is an important development to sustain and enhance midwifery care in our island community and we are grateful to UHI and the Scottish Government for making this possible.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.uhi.ac.uk/midwifery">programme</a>, which is subject to Nursing Midwifery Council approval, is due to begin in January 2019. The Scottish Government will provide &pound;500,000 of funding for the first intake, with funding being reviewed annually.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government has supported six successive increases in midwifery student intakes (including a 18.3% increase in intake in 2018-19 academic year) and funding return to practice training to attract former midwives back into the profession.</p>

              <p>Social housing landlords will be able to make their properties more energy efficient, with money from a &pound;3.5 million decarbonisation fund.</p>
              <p>Local authorities and housing associations will be able to use the fund on projects that improve energy efficiency and decarbonise heating, for example when installing solar panels or air source heat pumps.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
              <p>Announcing the fund&nbsp;ahead of&nbsp;a Scottish Parliament debate, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This funding reflects our commitment to tackling fuel poverty and improving energy efficiency.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As well as assisting social landlords in decarbonising their heating , the Fund will also encourage innovative thinking and fresh ideas, and is open to expressions of interest from today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is part of more than &pound;5 million of additional funding to support the Energy Efficient Scotland: Transition Programme, which will continue to provide a mix of advice, grant and low cost loans to support property owners over the next two years.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Funding will be available to Local Authority and Housing Association landlords across 2018/19 and 2019/20. The majority will be front-loaded, requiring spend in the current financial year 2018/19.</p>

              <p>Every pupil in Scotland will have access to an online account with personalised support in choosing courses and planning a career, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has announced.</p>
              <p>It is one of seventeen recommendations in a review, published today, of the journey through the education system for 15-24 year olds.</p>
              <p>From 2019, pupils will have their own learner account where they can record their skills and qualifications and receive help in planning next steps into further learning or work.</p>
              <p>Other recommendations to be taken forward by the Scottish Government, its agencies and the wider sector include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>More joined-up advice and guidance on post-school options across the education sector.</li>
              <li>Young people to receive a better balance of work-based and academic skills informed by employer engagement, building on the success of the Developing the Young Workforce programme.</li>
              <li>Improved collaboration between schools, colleges and universities to enable, where appropriate, greater flexibility for young people to move from S5 to year one of a degree, from S6 to year 2, and from college into years 2 and 3 of university.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Deputy First Minister John Swinney said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our school leavers now have a widening range of opportunities available - from industry-led technical professional options to long standing well-established academic routes. But what is clear is there is no single route to success in life.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;With a record proportion of school leavers going on to a positive destination, there is much to celebrate already. This review will build on firm foundations and challenges all of us within the education and skills sector to go further.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Ensuring the right advice, support and guidance fits seamlessly around a pupil is vital. Schools, colleges, universities and employers must work together to help young people navigate what is, rightly, a wide and varied range of post-school opportunities.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Taking forward these recommendations will require strong leadership across the sector but will ensure all young people are supported to take the learner journey that is right for them.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Rebecca Slater, 19, from Aberdeen is an enquiry officer at Student Awards Agency Scotland who joined in 2017 as a modern apprentice. She said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I began my learner journey when I moved from Aberdeen to Edinburgh, to start studying veterinary medicine at Edinburgh University. I chose to study this as, being someone who puts animal care at the centre of their life, I thought I would very much enjoy this career path.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;However, by the end of the academic session, I discovered the course was not actually for me and I would rather be in employment, so I left after first year and started to look for Modern Apprenticeships, where I could gain a qualification through my employment. This was very attractive to me as it was great to be able to get a qualification whilst I worked.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I was lucky enough to find a job at SAAS through the modern apprentice scheme and recently gained my qualification for my SVQ in customer service. I really recommend the modern apprentice route and think more could be done to promote apprenticeship opportunities at school as university is not for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The report on the 15-24 Learner Journey Review can be viewed on the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2018/05/4774">Scottish Government website</a>.</p>
              <p>The review, established in 2016, involved young people across Scotland and engaged with schools, parents, colleges, universities, employers and a wide range of public bodies.</p>
              <p>Key facts:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>In 2015/16, 37.3 per cent of all school leavers went on to higher education, 22.4 per cent into further education, 28.7 per cent into employment.</li>
              <li>Between 2007 and 2017 there has been an 18 percentage point increase in young people staying on to S6. Of those progressing from S6 to university, only around 1.4 per cent enter at year two of university.</li>
              <li>In 2014/15, 8,402 HNC/D&nbsp; students progressed onto university. Of this 48% articulated with Advanced Standing (where their credit was fully recognised); 10% with Advanced Progression (only some of their credit was recognised) and 42% with Progression (their credit was not recognised).</li>
              <li>In 2016, 91 per cent of completers of a Modern Apprenticeship were in work 6 months after the completion date.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>More than 200 engagements between Scottish Government ministers and European governments, institutions and organisations have taken place since the start of 2017.</p>
              <p>The &lsquo;strong desire&rsquo; to connect with Scotland and listen to our views signals that the EU continues to see Scotland as an important partner &ndash; according to External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop.</p>
              <p>In just 16 months, Scottish Government ministers have initiated or accepted more than 200 meetings and visits with European partners, which on average means a European engagement has taken place at least three times per week.</p>
              <p>As she marked Europe Day 2017 &ndash; a day to celebrate the shared history and culture of EU members &ndash; Ms Hyslop said the Scottish Government would be stepping up its engagement with EU countries still further, and that it was more important than ever for Scotland&rsquo;s voice to be heard.</p>
              <p>Ms Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The strong desire by our European partners to engage has never been greater.</p>
              <p>People in Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and there were majorities for remain in every local authority area. We are determined to make Scotland&rsquo;s voice heard as we enter a crucial stage in the Brexit negotiations and will be stepping up our engagement plans.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Whatever the outcome, it is essential that we continue our collaboration, friendship and partnership with EU nations.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our knowledge, expertise and leadership in many areas of shared interest &ndash; such as rural economic development, climate change, innovation and culture &ndash; mean the soft power influence we exert is significant.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Leaving the EU is against the democratic will of the people of Scotland, but we also firmly believe it is the wrong course for the UK as a whole. The continued membership of the single market, which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone, and customs union is essential for our economy, society and people.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Yet what is also clear is that, despite the threat of Brexit, Scotland&rsquo;s interconnections with EU countries can and must remain strong. Through all avenues, channels and networks available, we are taking steps to safeguard these critical relationships.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Scottish Government EU engagements since the start of 2017 have included:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The opening of Scottish Government Hubs in Berlin and Dublin</li>
              <li>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon&rsquo;s visits to Dublin, Bonn and Utrecht</li>
              <li>Engagements by the First Minister and Michael Russell in Brussels</li>
              <li>High level meetings by Fiona Hyslop in Paris, The Hague and Berlin</li>
              <li>Engagements by Europe Minister Alasdair Allan in Oslo, Riga and Bratislava</li>
              <li>Hosting an Arctic Circle gathering in Edinburgh</li>
              <li>Hosting visits by delegations from EU member states and institutions to Scotland</li>
              <li>Co-hosting in Edinburgh the OECD Rural Development Conference</li>
              <li>Briefing sessions with the Scotland-based Consular Corps</li>
              <li>Meetings between Scottish Ministers and EU Ambassadors</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition to these ministerial contacts, there are numerous day to day, official-to-official contacts on a diverse range of policy areas.</p>

              <p>Refugees can now organise financial support for family members before they are reunited in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Up to &pound;100,000 in Family Reunion Crisis Grants will smooth the path for new arrivals, bridging the gap before they can be assessed for benefits entitlement.</p>
              <p>The grants provide assistance with initial living costs as well as essential items, such as beds, for those arriving in Scotland under family reunion rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Too many people arriving in Scotland under family reunion arrangements are forced to start their new life in abject poverty because they cannot apply for support until they arrive here. When you consider that these people have been separated from their families, have fled their home &ndash; often under threats of violence and death &ndash; that is not acceptable.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland is a welcoming country and we want everyone who chooses it as their new home to be able to do so with a sense of safety, security and hope for their future here. We firmly believe in supporting refugees from the day they get here and these grants are an example of how we can provide practical support for people to get back on their feet and take their place as valued members of our communities.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Phil Arnold, Head of Refugee Support for the British Red Cross said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Being with family is one of the most basic instincts that people have, and this is no different for refugees. By introducing grants for newly reunited families, we can make sure they face a more certain future together, and remove the risk of refugee families falling into destitution or homelessness. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Families with children are especially more likely to experience problems because of the longer time it takes to process Child Tax Credit compared with other benefits and because they usually need to move to larger accommodation. This is a real risk and it is particularly concerning because they place additional strain on reuniting families at a critical time recovering from their individual and collective ordeals, when the family just wants to get on and rebuild their home and family life together in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Hadgu was separated from his family for three and a half years before they arrived in Scotland in March 2018.&nbsp; He said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Nothing makes me happier than to be reunited with my wife Helen and my three daughters. The Red Cross have been great supporting me with crisis grants and have been helping me find new accommodation as we&rsquo;re now over crowded in our small flat.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The release of Labour Productivity Statistics up to the final quarter of 2017 (October-December), including the first estimates for 2017 as a whole, were announced today by Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician. Key figures in the latest release are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>In 2017, annual labour productivity in Scotland, as measured by output per hour worked, decreased by 1.9% in real terms (inflation adjusted) compared to 2016.</li>
              <li>Additionally, this release contains a trend-based estimate of productivity growth. This indicates the underlying rate of change during the latest quarter by removing both seasonal and irregular (volatile) movements from the data. It is estimated that the trend in real output per hour worked increased by 1.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017.</li>
              <li>The publication also includes estimates of output per job and current price productivity measures (not adjusted for inflation). Experimental estimates of labour productivity for broad industry groups are also available online.</li>

              <p>New funding to support entrepreneurs has been announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.</p>
              <p>The &pound;650,000 investment into Entrepreneurial Scotland will help drive entrepreneurial networks so that budding entrepreneurs can use them to share ideas, experience and seek support, investment and expertise.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the first Scotland CAN DO festival at Barras Art and Design in Glasgow, which brings together around 400 entrepreneurial leaders, change makers and innovators to share their ideas, the First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland is known for its vision as a world-leading entrepreneurial and innovative nation, one in which growth and innovation go hand-in-hand with fair work and delivering in a way which benefits everyone.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want Scotland to be a country that is at the forefront of social and technological progress &ndash; to invent, design and manufacture the technologies and products of the future &ndash; not simply to consume them. And we want to do all of that in a way which benefits all of society.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;That's why, in recent years, we&rsquo;ve placed a heavy emphasis on encouraging more people to be entrepreneurs &ndash; to set up new businesses and social enterprises and for the government itself to be more entrepreneurial. With partners from across all sectors we have championed this vision through Scotland CAN DO.&nbsp; It is a platform for us all &ndash; across all sectors &ndash; to sharpen our focus on enabling sustainable economic growth and to deliver a Scotland that is a CAN DO place for business.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>New support will help ensure community organisations, charities and other grassroots groups are listened to during the ongoing Brexit negotiations.</p>
              <p>The &pound;150,000 stakeholder engagement fund will provide grants to Scottish organisations who wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have the resources to gather and promote the views of their members on preparing for the UK leaving the EU.</p>
              <p>The new fund will focus primarily on enabling community and third sector organisations to consider the impact of Brexit, highlight their concerns and plan for the future &nbsp;&ndash; giving them a greater platform to be heard at a Scottish, UK and EU level.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government fund will offer organisations and networks targeted financial support, as well as welcoming suggestions and ideas from local community groups around the country.</p>
              <p>Launching the fund on Europe Day, Minister for Negotiations on Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe Michael Russell said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As I meet with organisations throughout Scotland, one thing I hear time and again is that while they are worried about Brexit, pressure on resources means they simply don&rsquo;t have the capacity to plan for it.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This new fund is about ensuring the full range of voices can be heard, not just those with specialist staff and big budgets. So I want this fund to be a megaphone for under-represented groups across the country.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Many community organisations are led by ordinary people doing extraordinary things. We need to hear their views and, given the huge uncertainty that Brexit is causing, do all we can to help them prepare.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There are obvious risks around funding, staffing and future opportunities so it is important that we fully understand these concerns and what can be done to help.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>A fund, which supports the introduction of new walking and cycling infrastructure, will be more than doubled, Transport Minister Humza Yousaf has announced.</p>
              <p>&pound;36m will be available through the Community Links Fund in 2018/19, the highest amount since it was launched in 2010.</p>
              <p>The fund has previously helped projects like the cycling and walking path between Elgin and Lhanbryde, a cycle path linking Glasgow City Centre with its southern suburbs, and plans to redesign Stirling Road in Dunblane.</p>
              <p>Mr Yousaf said: &ldquo;We want Scotland to be an active nation, where people lead healthier and more active lifestyles.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Cyclists often tell me they want to see more safe cycling infrastructure, which I fully endorse and is one of the reasons why this is the highest amount we&rsquo;ve ever invested in the Community Links Fund.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want this extra money to create pleasant and safe routes which make it easier for people of all ages to choose to walk and cycle as part of their everyday lives.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is a great opportunity for organisations to bring forward projects that will encourage people to make active travel a bigger part of their daily lives and realise the health and environmental benefits that come with it.</p>
              <p>John Lauder, National Director for Sustrans Scotland, which delivers the fund, said: &ldquo;Increasing everyday levels of active travel can hugely benefit a person&rsquo;s health and wellbeing, boost local economies and create greener, more pleasant local environments to live and travel through.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This increased funding for active travel routes from the Scottish Government demonstrates its continued commitment to creating safe and accessible walking and cycling routes across the country.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with Transport Scotland, local authorities, community trusts and other partners up and down the country to help deliver the Scottish Government&rsquo;s vision for an Active Nation.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her Cabinet will meet in the Clyde Gateway regeneration area on Monday, 21 May.</p>
              <p>Clyde Gateway is Scotland&rsquo;s biggest regeneration programme covering 840 hectares in the east end of Glasgow and Rutherglen.</p>
              <p>Cabinet Secretaries will take part in a full day of events to mark a decade of investment in the area, culminating in a public discussion at the Emirates Arena led by the First Minister.</p>
              <p>The Clyde Gateway event is the latest in a series of more than 40 Cabinet meetings that have taken place in towns and cities across Scotland, including Cupar, Dumfries, Aberdeen, Alloa, Inverness, Ullapool, Oban and Greenock.</p>
              <p>Speaking ahead of the Clyde Gateway events, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is an opportunity for me and my Cabinet to meet businesses, community groups and local residents in the Clyde Gateway area, including young people in this Year of Young People.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The discussion takes place in the Emirates Arena and I would encourage the local community to attend. This is a chance to air your views and raise key issues that matter to you.</p>

              <p>A Scottish company at the forefront of genetic medical research has been awarded a &pound;1.9 grant to expand its programme of cell and gene therapy.</p>
              <p>Synpromics Ltd, based in Roslin, is pioneering research that could unlock a one treatment cure for diseases such as leukaemia and certain types of blindness. The Scottish Enterprise research and development (R&amp;D) grant will enable the firm to invest a total of &pound;5.4 million in this area, creating 11 new jobs.</p>
              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met Dr Michael Roberts, Synpromics founder and Chief Scientific Officer , at the Scottish Council for Development and Industry&rsquo;s annual forum in Edinburgh &ndash; where she welcomed that the company were the 475<sup>th</sup> to commit to the Scottish Business Pledge.</p>
              <p>The First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our commitment to increasing R&amp;D is about providing the support innovative companies need to develop products and solutions that meet the future challenges facing both Scotland and the global economy. This latest grant means that, since we raised R&amp;D funding last autumn, we have supported 40 projects with grants totalling &pound;33 million.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Synpromics is an excellent example of a fast-growing Scottish company with vision and ambition. Their expertise in world-leading gene therapy research has the potential to be truly life changing for patients.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As the latest company to sign the Business Pledge &ndash; the 475<sup>th</sup> in Scotland &ndash; I also welcome that Synpromics are demonstrating their commitment to being a fair and forward thinking business.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Dr Michael Roberts said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am delighted that Synpromics have been able to sign up to the Scottish Business Pledge, which signals our commitment to creating a diverse and engaged team to enable us to drive innovation and sustainable global business growth.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This investment will help fund Synpromics&rsquo; state-of-the-art research and build on the success of gene control technology programmes to date, focused on designing innovative cell and gene therapies. With this technology, we can enable the development of novel medicines for a range of devastating diseases where the current treatment options are limited or non-existent.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Rhona Allison, Interim Managing Director at Scottish Enterprise, added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Synpromics&rsquo; work has the potential to transform the lives of millions of people across the globe, and this latest project is a fantastic example of the company&rsquo;s cutting-edge research in the critical field of revolutionary new gene therapies.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Innovation and innovative research is key to driving Scotland&rsquo;s economic growth. Our R&amp;D support not only recognises this project&rsquo;s importance to Synpromics but also to the Scottish economy and our growing global reputation as a hub for life science excellence.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.synpromics.com/about-us">Synpromics</a>&rsquo; research involves synthetic gene promoters, which control genes in highly specific conditions.

              <p>Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland's Place in Europe Michael Russell has reiterated the need for changes to the EU Withdrawal Bill to protect devolution, following a meeting with the UK Government in London.</p>
              <p>Mr Russell confirmed there are still options which would secure an agreement, with two solutions suggested to the UK Government at the Joint Ministerial Committee on European Negotiations.</p>
              <p>The Minister said:</p>
              <p>"We continue to look for agreement between the governments but not at any price. That means I will keep seeking an agreed outcome that protects devolution and we have put forward two solutions that would achieve that goal. The bill can still be amended at third reading in the House of Lords.</p>
              <p>"Under the current UK Government proposal, we could see the powers of the Scottish Parliament changed without the consent of parliament for the first time ever.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"The legislation would also give the UK Government the power to prevent the Scottish Parliament from passing legislation in key areas such as farming, fishing and the environment for up to seven years.</p>
              <p>"I have made it perfectly clear that the bill must respect the existing devolution settlement and that is why I will continue to try to deliver changes to protect the principles of devolution.</p>
              <p>"While there is a short amount of time for further negotiation,&nbsp; the Scottish Parliament will now consider whether the EU Withdrawal Bill should be given legislative consent.&nbsp;We will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament and I hope the UK Government will also do so.</p>
              <p>"As well as the discussions on the EU Withdrawal Bill, I also took the opportunity to once again highlight the significant evidence that our economy, jobs and communities would be best served by remaining within the Single Market and Customs Union and avoiding the economic disaster of a hard Brexit.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison has put in place additional scrutiny around NHS finances in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government will provide monthly information on NHS Boards financial performance to the Scottish Parliament following the boards first submissions for this financial year, which are due in June.</p>
              <p>The Health Secretary also confirmed that the first quarterly financial report on Health and Social Care Integration Authorities had been provided to the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Health and Sport committee and that medium term spending plans for the health service would be set out later this year.</p>
              <p>She also repeated commitments to work with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator to implement any recommendations following their investigation of the use of endowment funds by NHS Boards.</p>
              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am immensely proud of our NHS. Staff do a fantastic job, day in and day out despite ever-increasing demands on our systems.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In these times of increased pressure, with rising demand and an aging population, it is crucial we have a transparent and open approach to finances and that matters of significant concern come to the fore.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;A number of steps have already been put in place to increase transparency and accountability including quarterly reporting to the parliament by integrated joint boards and we will move from our proposal to provide quarterly financial reports from health boards to providing information on a monthly basis &ndash; as soon as we receive them from the boards.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In addition I will expect everyone to learn lessons from recent issues at NHS Tayside and I have already committed that the Scottish Government will work with OSCR on any recommendations they have on the use of charitable endowment funds. I can however confirm there is nothing in the responses that gives cause for concern and no boards are showing retrospective payments in order to improve their financial position as at NHS Tayside.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s health service has record levels of staffing and is receiving record levels of funding, as a result of the decisions of this government. We will continue to work alongside our valuable NHS staff to deliver real investment, to continue to improve services, and to provide the level of care to patients that they have a right to expect.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Ross Finnie, Chair of public watchdog agency Food Standards Scotland has written to the Minister of UK Negotiations on Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe, Michael Russell, highlighting his &ldquo;concerns about the risks and potential detriment to consumers in Scotland&rdquo; of the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals to take control of devolved responsibilities following Brexit, including in areas relating to food standards.</p>
              <p>In his letter, Mr Finnie says that if such matters are reserved to the UK Government, &ldquo;it will be difficult for Scottish stakeholders&rsquo; voices to be heard, or for the needs of businesses or consumers in Scotland to be given priority&rdquo;.</p>
              <p>He goes on to cite policies to tackle obesity and the issue of food and drink labelling as areas which could be adversely affected, saying that the UK Government&rsquo;s stance &ldquo;suggests a potential shift that is too much towards protecting businesses interests at the expense of consumers&rsquo; interests&rdquo;, adding that &ldquo;as long as public health is devolved, then it makes no sense that the tools to tackle these issues are reserved.</p>
              <p>Mr Russell has replied, outlining the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on UK-wide common frameworks after Brexit.</p>
              <p>Read both letters below.</p>
              <p>Letter to Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe</p>
              <p>22 March 2018</p>
              <p>Dear Mike</p>
              <p>There will be no one more acutely aware than you of the implications for Scotland of the position articulated by the UK Government of the twenty four areas where they consider that it will be necessary, when the UK leaves the EU, for them to take control of matters of devolved competence that are currently regulated through EU law. As you know, that list includes food (and feed) safety, hygiene, compositional standards and labelling, including matters concerning nutrition and health.</p>
              <p>I am sure that you will appreciate that as Chair of a non-Ministerial public body created by an Act of the Scottish Parliament, I would be failing in my duty to the Parliament if I did not write to you to set out my concerns. The reservation of these powers to Westminster upon exiting the EU would prevent Food Standards Scotland from discharging its statutory functions as set out in the Food (Scotland) Act 2015, and in meeting the wider objectives of Scottish Ministers in terms of protecting public health and improving diet, whilst regulating the food and feed sectors in accordance with the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 and the Scottish Regulators Strategic Code of Practice.</p>
              <p>Clearly, negotiations are ongoing between the Scottish and UK Governments, but from the perspective of food safety and standards, it seems likely that UKG will argue the need for cross-UK consistency as being essential for trade once the UK leaves the EU as regulatory assurance is intrinsic to securing trade deals. However, if those matters are reserved to the UKG to determine, it will be difficult for Scottish stakeholders&rsquo; voices to be heard, or for the needs of businesses or consumers in Scotland to be given priority. I have outlined below some practical examples of the consequences of these areas being entirely reserved to UKG.</p>
              <p>The SG has recently completed a consultation on developing a strategy to reduce obesity in Scotland. Reservation to the UK of policy and legislation on food standards and labelling mean that Scotland would not have competence to regulate in this area to improve public health. On the basis of the UKG&rsquo;s view, there can be no differences of approach across the UK to ensure the &lsquo;integrity of the UK internal market&rsquo;. Similarly, in relation to adding information about alcohol units to labels on alcoholic drinks, if food labelling is reserved, this labelling would not be something that Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament could determine, as the legal competence for labelling would be reserved to Westminster. And while the stated purpose of the UK Government is to consider temporarily withholding powers in</p>
              <p>these areas, the justification for doing so &ndash; to protect the internal market in the UK - does not imply any time bar to such a restriction. Furthermore, the focus on the internal market fundamentally undermines the other responsibilities of Scottish Ministers and there appears to be no acknowledgement of that either. Government interventions in the &ldquo;internal market&rdquo; are not new and in fact, as you know, are fundamental to how Government makes improvements it desires in areas such as public health.</p>
              <p>From a general public health perspective, with respect to the issues of regulation on the safety, labelling and composition of foods, this currently clearly falls within devolved competence and links closely to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s overall strategic objectives in public health improvement. As Chair of a public health body, protection of the internal market and facilitation of trade at the expense of Scotland being able to determine the right market intervention measures to ensure public health protection suggests a potential shift that is too much towards protecting businesses interests at the expense of consumers&rsquo; interests. The reality is that most of our regulatory remit &ndash; and indeed the UKG&rsquo;s in relation to these matters in England - involves a degree of intervention in the market to deliver public health</p>
              <p>benefits. As long as public health is devolved, then it makes no sense that the tools to tackle these issues are reserved. At best, UKG would simply agree to changes that Scottish Government asks for (although this assume changes wouldn&rsquo;t interfere with the internal market), but at worst, any health protection measures could be enabled only with the permission and agreement of UKG. The &ldquo;track record&rdquo; in this regard is not promising.</p>
              <p>There are examples of how the UKG has responded on reserved issues that impact on devolved matters. On the advertising of foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar, FSS has recommended more action be taken to regulate how these products can be advertised and marketed. SG Ministers have consequently sought powers in this regard, but these have not been forthcoming. Scotland has also demonstrated the willingness to act on a UK basis where the evidence shows that it makes sense to do so. Most recently this has been in relation to the fortification of bread and flour with folic acid, to improve health outcomes related to births affected by neural tube defects, yet the UKG has steadfastly shown no signs of intervening in the market to improve health outcomes.</p>
              <p>If the UKG&rsquo;s proposals do proceed, then Scotland&rsquo;s food regulator would lose its status as the policy maker and competent authority in Scotland in areas where the UK Government propose restrictions on Scottish Ministers and that competence has been conferred on FSS. In these areas FSS would become subservient to the wishes of the UKG, and whichever Whitehall department it conferred competence on a UK basis. Such a reservation of competence would put Scotland in a significantly worse position than before FSS was established in 2015. Whilst FSA acted across the UK before FSS was established, it did so in a landscape where competence was devolved to Scottish Parliament through Scottish Ministers. Going forward even that would no longer be the case. If the UKG&rsquo;s proposals become reality, competence would with the UK departments (FSA/Defra/DH) and accountability would be to Westminster.</p>
              <p>Of course, in the context of Brexit and the very many difficulties associated with it, I fully recognise that some compromise between governments will be necessary. My purpose in writing this letter is to put on record my concerns about the risks and potential detriment to consumers in Scotland, should Ministers and the Parliament be unable in future to act in their best interests.</p>
              <p>A copy of this letter goes to Cabinet Secretaries, Shona Robison and Fergus Ewing, Aileen Campbell Minister for Public Health and Geoff Ogle FSS CEO.</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely</p>

              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>01 May 2018</p>
              <p>Dear Ross</p>
              <p>Thank you for your letter of 22 March.</p>
              <p>I am very grateful to you for sharing your concerns with me. These highlight clearly the very important matters at stake and why it is so important that we protect the powers of the Scottish Parliament, so that Food Standards Scotland can continue to get on with the vital work of protecting consumers in Scotland in these key devolved areas.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>You will be aware of the on-going discussions between the Scottish Government and the UK Government on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. Whilst good progress has been made in agreeing where common frameworks across the UK may be appropriate in the future upon EU exit, it is essential that this is done on a basis of trust between the governments and where the Scottish Parliament agrees that is appropriate.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately the UK Government&rsquo;s proposed amendments to the Bill do not proceed on this basis. Under these amendments regulations would be made under clause 11 by the UK Government which would prevent the Scottish Parliament from exercising its responsibilities in these areas for up to 7 years, whether or not the Scottish Parliament agrees to those arrangements. The Scottish Government could not recommend that approach to the Parliament.</p>
              <p>I note that in your letter you express concern at the UK Government&rsquo;s argument that a temporary restriction is required in order to protect the &ldquo;UK internal market&rdquo;. You point out that this justification does not in fact imply restrictions should be time limited. Worryingly the UK Government did indeed use this argument when it published its amendments on Wednesday. We are also concerned at the implications this line of argument will have for the longer-term or permanent reservation of devolved powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>My position throughout has been clear, that the principles of devolution must be respected and that if the competence of the Scottish Parliament to legislate in respect of devolved matters is to be restricted in any way, then the Parliament&rsquo;s consent must first be obtained.</p>
              <p>It remains the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position that we are not opposed to common frameworks where these are in Scotland&rsquo;s best interests.&nbsp; However, we will continue to defend the right of the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government to decide what those best interests are.</p>
              <p>I understand my officials are in contact with yours to further explore the matters you have raised in detail and are working together to counter any potential negative impacts on our policy ambitions.&nbsp; I would also like to thank you for informing me of these risks and I can assure you that the Scottish Government will continue to do all that it can to protect public health in Scotland.&nbsp; I hope this reply offers you some reassurance and I am grateful to you for agreeing that your letter and my response could be made public for the purpose of informing debate on this matter.&nbsp; I would be happy to meet with you to discuss further.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Michael Russell</p>

              <p>Funding of &pound;54.5 million to help tackle fuel poverty and reduce greenhouse gas emissions has been announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the All Energy conference in Glasgow, the First Minister launched the Route Map to an Energy Efficient Scotland, which outlines action to ensure that by 2040, all homes are improved so they achieve an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of at least Band C.</p>
              <p>Supported by &pound;54.5 million funding, the Route Map confirms that landlords of privately rented homes will be required to achieve an Energy Performance Certificate rating of Band E from April 2020 at change of tenancy, and then Band D from 2022. All private rented properties will need to be EPC Band E by end March 2022 and Band D by end March 2025. This is aimed at ensuring private rented tenants live in homes which are warmer and more affordable to heat.</p>
              <p>The funding will also support local authorities to expand their existing energy efficiency and fuel poverty programmes. And it will continue to support building owners to develop local heat and energy efficiency strategies as well as making funding available to social landlords to help them install low carbon heating systems such as air and ground source heat pumps.</p>
              <p>The First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government&rsquo;s energy efficiency programme will help ensure all our buildings are warmer, greener and more energy efficient.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The major investment in this programme highlights our clear commitment to ensuring that we tackle fuel poverty and reduce greenhouse gas emissions &ndash; helping those on low incomes as well as protecting our environment.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Cllr Elena Whitman, COSLA Community Wellbeing Spokesperson said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The publication of the Energy Efficiency Scotland Route Map is welcomed by Scottish Councils. Our buildings need to be comfortable to work and live in, and heating them should be affordable. The route map will address this and is a priority for council leaders.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Local Government is ready to work in a constructive partnership with the Scottish Government. We&rsquo;ve a good record of achievement on area based schemes. We want to deliver the ambitious targets and harness the significant local economic benefits that should result.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>View the<a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2018/05/1462">&nbsp;Energy Efficient Scotland route map</a>&nbsp;and our pages about <a href="http://beta.gov.scot/policies/energy-efficiency/">energy efficiency</a>.</p>
              <p>The All Energy Conference is a UK-wide renewable and low carbon innovation event which brings together developers, researchers and buyers with policy makers from across the UK&rsquo;s renewable energy, low carbon heat, energy efficiency and low carbon transport industries.</p>
              <p>The &pound;54.5 million of funding in 2018/19 will be allocated as follows:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>&pound;49 million of funding will be allocated to support Home Energy Efficiency Programmes for Scotland: Area Based Schemes in 2018/19 which provide energy efficiency measures to a large number of Scottish households and help to tackle fuel poverty.</li>
              <li>&pound;5.5 million to support the Energy Efficient Scotland: Transition Programme to help local authorities to expand their existing energy efficiency and fuel poverty programmes to also support building owners who can afford to pay, further help them in developing local heat and energy efficiency strategies and make available funding to social landlords to help them install low carbon heating systems such as air and ground source heat pumps.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Scottish Government has introduced a cashback incentive to the SME loan scheme, which offers cashback of up to 30% of costs of energy efficiency works (up to &pound;10,000).</p>

              <p>People considering stopping smoking are being urged to get support to help them through the first 72 hours, and beyond.</p>
              <p>Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell and former Bay City Rollers lead singer Gordon Clark met in Edinburgh&rsquo;s Grassmarket to highlight the free smoking cessation advice offered by Scotland&rsquo;s Quit Your Way service. Mr Clark, 67, a founding member of the band, successfully gave up his 40-year-long smoking habit last year after attending a local support group and starting a 12-week plan.</p>
              <p>A campaign signposting the support available from the Quit Your Way service has already resulted in a 136 per cent rise in helpline calls and webchats in the first&nbsp;three weeks, compared with the same period in 2017.</p>
              <p>The campaign acknowledges that for some people the first 72 hours of quitting can be particularly tough as the body craves nicotine, but that with the right support smokers are twice as likely to stop smoking for good.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>New research highlights that almost three quarters of smokers (73 per cent) have attempted to quit in the past, with one in five (22 per cent) currently trying.</p>
              <p>Three quarters of those surveyed (75 per cent) agreed that the first 72 hours of giving up smoking are the hardest, with 82 per cent stating that the mental cravings can be harder to overcome than the physical cravings when quitting.</p>
              <p>Quit Your Way Scotland is the national stop smoking service from NHS 24 and provides people who are thinking about quitting with individually tailored advice, either over the phone or online.</p>
              <p>Ms Campbell said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Not everyone finds quitting smoking easy and the first 72 hours can be tough.&nbsp; But with the right support, people can get through those initial difficult days and beyond.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Trained Quit Your Way advisers are on hand to help people deal with the triggers that make them want to smoke, such as after a meal, or when out with friends.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re thinking about stopping smoking, getting the support that&rsquo;s right for you can hugely increase your chances of having a successful quit attempt, and stopping for good.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Mr Clark said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tried to quit several times with varying levels of success, probably because I wasn&rsquo;t in the right frame of mind.&nbsp; Last year I knew I really wanted to make a change and went along to a local support group.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I used a combination of nicotine patches and chewing gum and gradually reduced the size of the patches to slowly wean myself off, using gum as an emergency back-up.&nbsp; By the end of the 12 weeks, I&rsquo;d managed to quit altogether.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;For me, the hardest habit to break was having a cigarette first thing with a cuppa. I found the support of the group really helpful. There&rsquo;s a good sense of community and you meet people from all walks of life who are having the same experiences which makes it a bit easier. I still go along to get advice and offer support to others, even though I&rsquo;ve completely stopped.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed a huge difference in my health. I used to be on two inhalers a day which I&rsquo;ve done away with, and I haven&rsquo;t had any chest infections.&nbsp; My vocal range has also totally changed. Life free from nicotine feels great.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Sheila Duffy, Chief Executive of health charity ASH Scotland, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As Gordon says, making that choice for yourself is key. Some smokers just stop, and find it easier than they thought. For others it can take a number of tries to find out what works best. Each time you try, you will learn something about yourself.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There's no one way that works for everyone, but quitting smoking is well worth it however many attempts it takes to succeed. It's the best thing you can do for your own health and for those you love.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Accessibility campaigners in Dundee will welcome the news Transport Minister Humza Yousaf has approved Changing Places facilities at the city&rsquo;s key rail station.</p>
              <p>PAMIS, one of the key campaign groups, have been championing the need for Changing Places toilets at Dundee Station.&nbsp; These much called-for facilities, which are designed to meet the needs of people with complex care needs, are expected to be installed at a cost of around &pound;80,000.</p>
              <p>Work will be programmed to start&nbsp; once the redeveloped station opens in July 2018. This ensures the station remains on schedule to open before the Open at Carnoustie.</p>
              <p>Mr Yousaf said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is important we continually work to identify ways to improve accessibility and passenger experiences for all transport users.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Providing facilities such as Changing Places toilets goes a great way to help achieve this. That is why I am delighted to approve the installation of these at Dundee Station.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Jenny Miller, CEO of PAMIS, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;PAMIS are delighted that the Minister for Transport and Islands, Humza Yousaf, has approved the much needed Changing Places toilet at Dundee Railway Station. This is a fantastic outcome after a lengthy campaign by ourselves and families across the area.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have supported ScotRail from their initial plans and will continue to support and advise until completion. We are thrilled that Transport Scotland is so committed to inclusion and has supported this addition to Dundee. On behalf of our PAMIS families we are so grateful."</p>
              <p>Phil Campbell, ScotRail&rsquo;s Head of Customer Operations, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted that the ScotRail Alliance has been able to provide a Changing Places toilet for our customers using Dundee station. This fits in with the huge changes which the City of Dundee is currently seeing.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our network is for everyone, and ensuring this is all part of our plan to build the best railway Scotland has ever had.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Once opened,&nbsp; the Changing Places toilet will provide station users with a superior facility, such as those already installed at Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley. A further facility is planned for Glasgow Queen Street as part of the station enhancement project.</p>

              <p>The latest publication of Quarterly National Accounts Scotland (QNAS) was announced today by Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician. This publication includes statistics for the final quarter of 2017 (October-December). Key statistics in the publication are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>During 2017 as a whole the value of Scotland&rsquo;s onshore GDP is estimated at &pound;152.1 billion in total, or &pound;28,046 per person, in current prices.</li>
              <li>Including a geographical share of UK extra-regio (offshore and overseas) economic activity, Scottish GDP is estimated at &pound;165.4 billion in total, or &pound;30,482 per person during the latest 12 months.</li>
              <li>Over the year to end 2017, compared to 2016, the expenditure measure of onshore Gross Domestic Product shows that the increase in GDP in current prices (not real terms) was mostly driven by consumer spending and net trade. Capital investment made a negative contribution to GDP growth over the latest year.</li>
              <li>Manufactured Exports make up around half of the total value of exports from Scotland to the rest of the world (excluding oil and gas). The Index of Manufactured Exports (IME) decreased by 2.9% in volume terms during the final quarter of 2017. On a rolling annual basis, comparing the most recent four quarters to the previous four quarters, the volume of manufactured exports increased by 7.4%.</li>
              <li>Over the year to 2017 Quarter 4, total consumer spending by the Household and Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) sectors is estimated to have increased by 3.3% in current prices (unadjusted for inflation, not real terms).</li>
              <li>Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) is estimated to have increased by 1.7% over the year to 2017 Quarter 4 (in current prices, not real terms). The Household Savings Ratio is 6.8 per cent in the latest quarter, compared to an average value of 7.6 per cent during 2017.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

              <p>Dentists are to be included in a scheme that has already helped 37 refugee doctors begin to re-train to work in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Following the success of the scheme, dentists will now be given the same training, language support, professional mentoring and work experience necessary so that their qualifications can be recognised by the General Dental Council.</p>
              <p>The New Refugee Doctors Project is run by the Bridges Programme and provides the most comprehensive support for refugees who were doctors in their home countries. It is expected 50 doctors and 10 dentists will be supported by the programme over the next year.</p>
              <p>Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The New Refugee Doctors Project has been a great success and is an example of how we can support refugees with medical skills start to practice in their new home country. Expanding the scheme to support dentists means Scotland will benefit from their expertise and highly specialised knowledge.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have a long history of welcoming refugees and are grateful for the contribution they make to our communities, economy and country. Projects like this show how we can embrace people now living in our country and make use of their skills to help others live better, healthier lives.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Rabah El-Hassan from Sudan recently passed her final clinical exam and has submitted her papers for General Medical Council (GMC) registration. She said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Refugee Doctors&rsquo; Project has been amazing and helped me so much - from the support I have received for my exams, to sorting out my registration.&nbsp;I am very thankful for the support I have received from everyone. My biggest hope now is that I will soon be working as a GP in my new home town of Glasgow.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Maggie Lennon, Director of the Bridges Programmes, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our doctors have worked extremely hard and have proved just how important it is to them to get back to practising medicine as quickly as they can.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;All of the doctors have made measurable progress towards their goals and in the coming year we will see many more gaining registration. This is down to their dedication and the quality of support from the project partners, and is delivering excellent value for money for the investment the Scottish Government has made in these remarkable women and men.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Students have begun the first course at Scotland&rsquo;s new film and television school as a result of Scottish Government funding.</p>
              <p>This is the first time the school &ndash; NFTS Scotland, which is part of the UK&rsquo;s National Film and Television School &ndash; has had a base outside the southeast of England. The school is working in partnership with BBC Scotland and is backed with &pound;475,000 of Scottish Government funding, offering courses in all aspects of film, television and games development at the BBC&rsquo;s Pacific Quay and Dumbarton studios.</p>
              <p>The school aims to provide bursary funding to a third of students in the first two years in order to improve diversity and inclusion in the screen sector. The Scottish Government and BBC are jointly funding the bursary scheme.</p>
              <p>Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop met students and tutors on the school&rsquo;s first course at Pacific Quay, a documentary storyline module led by BAFTA-nominated Peter Dale, former head of documentaries at Channel 4 and NFTS Co-Head of Documentary.</p>
              <p>Ms Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want to continue to support our growing screen industry. This new school will give people in Scotland the opportunity to develop their careers and move up the creative ladder, while also providing the industry with a stream of well-qualified talent.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The bursary scheme means people who might otherwise not be able to access this training can learn new skills so they are work-ready and can progress their careers. This will help people of all backgrounds benefit from these outstanding opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Student Meray Diner said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a huge privilege to be one of the first participants to enrol at NFTS Scotland. I couldn&rsquo;t have done without the support of the bursary fund provided by the Scottish Government and the BBC. Their support has helped start my journey towards fulfilling my dream to be a successful documentary director and producer in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Alison Goring, Head of NFTS Scotland, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic to open the doors of NFTS Scotland and welcome our first cohort onto the inaugural course. We have a packed schedule coming up over the next few months and a whole host of participants enrolled from a wide range of backgrounds. We look forward to playing an important role in supplying a consistent pipeline of local talent to our thriving and growing industry here in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>BBC Scotland Director Donalda MacKinnon, said:</p>
              <p>"It's an exciting time for the creative sector here in Scotland, and we're delighted to be able to play our part in helping NFTS students acquire and maintain the skills that we'll all need as the industry expands. BBC Scotland&rsquo;s plans to create more relevant content for our audiences, including a new channel, are about to step up a notch. So it's great news for our industry that we can welcome these students to our bases at Glasgow and Dumbarton."</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p><a href="https://nfts.co.uk/school/nfts-scotland">NFTS Scotland</a> will offer a range of bespoke courses to develop the creative talent and expertise of graduates and people already working in Scotland&rsquo;s screen sector. This will help to address skills gaps in specific areas which have been identified as priorities by employers.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government is providing an additional &pound;10 million for screen sector growth, production and development this year, bringing its investment in screen to &pound;20 million.</p>

              <p>People considering legal action to enforce their rights will have a wider range of funding options and better protection from court costs under new legislation.</p>
              <p>The passing of the Civil Litigation (Expenses and Group Proceedings) (Scotland) Bill will ensure civil justice is more affordable, predictable and accessible &ndash; while providing greater funding equity between claimants and defenders in personal injury actions.</p>
              <p>Minister for Legal Affairs Annabelle Ewing said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The potential costs involved in civil court action can deter many people from pursuing legal action, even where their claim may have good grounds for success.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This bill will improve the ability of people in Scotland who have a civil claim to pursue that case in the courts. It seeks to remove some of the barriers which, in the past, have deterred individuals from accessing justice in the civil courts.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Sheriff Principal James Taylor said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This bill achieves my objectives of rebalancing the relative bargaining strengths of parties to a personal injury litigation and properly regulating the funding system.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Gordon Dalyell, the Vice President of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL) said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;APIL welcomes this Bill, which recognises the vulnerability of injured people in the court process. By giving them greater clarity and certainty, the Bill will lead to a real increase in access to justice for people who need it most, and set a standard for the rest of the UK to follow.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Kim Leslie of the Law Society of Scotland&rsquo;s Civil Justice Committee said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We welcome the Bill. It will create a fairer, more accessible and affordable civil justice system for members of the Scottish public seeking redress through our courts.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Cabinet Secretary for External Affairs Fiona Hyslop has written to Sajid Javid on his appointment as Home Secretary.</p>
              <p>Ms Hyslop highlighted the key issues in relation to Scotland&rsquo;s unique population needs and has requested a meeting with Mr Javid to discuss these further.</p>
              <p>Full text of the letter is below.</p>
              <p>Dear Sajid</p>
              <p>I write to congratulate you on your new position as Home Secretary and look forward to working with you.</p>
              <p>I am aware you will be spending time being briefed on your new responsibilities and I would like to take this opportunity to outline some matters in relation to Scotland&rsquo;s population needs which deserve your immediate attention.</p>
              <p>Over the past 12 months the Scottish Government has published a series of reports and evidence, including to the Migration Advisory Committee, demonstrating the significant positive impact migrants make to Scotland&rsquo;s economy, our society and our communities and, as a result, the critical importance of migration to Scotland&rsquo;s future prosperity.</p>
              <p>I attach these published documents for your reference, including our evidence to the Migration Advisory Committee, our discussion paper entitled Scotland&rsquo;s population and migration policy: Discussion paper on evidence, policy and powers for the Scottish Parliament and our paper published in January this year entitled Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe:&nbsp; People, Jobs and Investment.</p>
              <p>Scotland is particularly vulnerable to any reduction in inward migration because of our distinct demographics. Across Scotland, as a whole population growth is projected to be driven entirely by migration with over a third of Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities facing depopulation over the 25 years to 2039.</p>
              <p>The most recent population estimates from the National Records of Scotland showed a welcome increase in the numbers of people moving to Scotland from the rest of the UK but a worrying decrease in the number coming from overseas.</p>
              <p>The economic importance of migration to Scotland cannot be overestimated. Scottish Government analysis submitted to the Migration Advisory Committee&rsquo;s call for evidence on the role of EEA workers in the UK labour market found that the average EU citizen in Scotland adds &pound;10,400 to government revenue and &pound;34,400 to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year.</p>
              <p>In addition to this, new economic modelling in our recently published document Scotland&rsquo;s population needs and migration policy quantifies the impact that lower migration post Brexit could have on the Scottish economy and found that by 2040, lower migration alone would reduce Scotland&rsquo;s real GDP by 4.5% - equivalent to a fall of almost &pound;5 billion a year. The reduction across the rest of the UK would be 3.7%, demonstrating the Scottish economy&rsquo;s greater reliance on migration.</p>
              <p>Further, in a &lsquo;worst case scenario&rsquo; where migration is reduced to tens of thousands, in line with UK Government policy, the cost to the Scottish economy could be &pound;10 billion per year by 2040 &ndash; I hope you agree that scenario would be utterly unacceptable.</p>
              <p>There is cross-party consensus that a distinct approach to migration for Scotland is required. Indeed on 22 February this year, the Scottish Parliament backed a motion calling for such an approach. There have also been calls from Westminster including the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration and the Scottish Affairs Committee, as well as from business groups including the Federation of Small Businesses and Scottish Council for Development and Industry for a solution which is tailored to Scotland&rsquo;s unique circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We are already seeing instances where people who are either able to fill particular skills gaps in Scotland or who provide essential services in rural areas have been prevented from coming to Scotland, or faced removal or deportation as a result of targets and criteria that simply do not take account of Scotland&rsquo;s needs, and where public bodies are facing an increase in the immigration skills charge that inhibits their ability to recruit essential staff from outwith the UK.</p>
              <p>I note the commitment that you made yesterday to a fair and humane immigration policy that welcomes and celebrates people who are here legally, people who have come in the past or who are looking to come and who want to do the right thing and contribute to our country. As part of that, I look forward to an early meeting with you to discuss the opportunities and ways in which Scotland&rsquo;s unique migration needs can be recognised &ndash; as set out in Scotland&rsquo;s population needs and migration policy &ndash; alongside the ways in which the immigration white paper could properly reflect Scotland&rsquo;s position and provide certainty and security to EU citizens, who have made their home here that has been denied to those of the Windrush generation.</p>
              <p>In light of the many public statements made repeatedly by the Prime Minister and other UK Government Ministers that they will engage fully with the Devolved Administrations, I look forward to an early meeting.</p>
              <p>I am copying this letter to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Minister of State for Immigration, as well as the Secretary of State for Scotland.</p>
              <p>Fiona Hyslop</p>

              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician today published statistics on Education Maintenance Allowances (EMA) in the academic year 2016-17. EMA provides financial support for young people from low-income households to overcome financial barriers to participate in appropriate school or college courses or an activity agreement.</p>
              <p>Key findings include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>31,675 school pupils, college students and individuals on activity agreements received EMA payments in Scotland in the academic year 2016-17, a slight decrease of 0.2% (-60) from 31,735 in 2015-16.</li>
              <li>School pupils account for 63.5% of young people in receipt of EMA payment, 32.2% being college students and the remaining 4.3% are young people on activity agreements.</li>
              <li>Of all 16-19 year old school pupils in Scotland, 29% received EMA payments in 2016-17.</li>
              <li>Of the potentially eligible 16-19 year old college students in Scotland, 33% received EMA payments in 2016-17.</li>
              <li>The proportion of EMA recipients living in Scotland&rsquo;s 20% most deprived areas in 2016-17 increased to 36.8% (11,615). Among school pupils and those with an activity agreements receiving EMA, 34.9% (7,460) were living in the 20% most deprived areas, while 40.8% (4,155) of college students receiving EMA were living in the 20% most deprived areas.</li>
              <li>The total amount spent on EMA payments in 2016-17 was &pound;24.6 million, a decrease of &pound;137,855 from &pound;24.8 million in 2015-16. Of this, &pound;17.3 million (70.1%) was paid out to school pupils and those with an activity agreement, and the remaining &pound;7.4 million (29.9%) paid out to young people attending college.</li>

              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison today praised the &lsquo;tremendous&rsquo; efforts of the NHS as figures show the number of operations in the NHS in March rose despite the severe weather.</p>
              <p>March saw unseasonably cold weather, with Scotland&rsquo;s first ever red weather alert across large parts of the country and the army providing assistance to get staff and patients to and from some hospitals through severe snow.</p>
              <p>25,399 operations took place in March 2018 compared to 23,664 in February 2018, a rise of 7.3%. This is despite evidence from some NHS Boards that the weather accounted for the majority of cancellations for capacity or non-clinical reasons:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>In NHS Lothian, 281 of the 417 cancellations for capacity or non-clinical reasons were due to the weather</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>In NHS Fife, 60 of the 91 cancellations for capacity or non-clinical reasons were due to the weather</li>
              <li>In NHS Highland 36 of the 68 cancellations for capacity or non-clinical reasons were due to the weather</li>
              <li>In NHS Borders, 28 of the 78 cancellations for capacity or non-clinical reasons or for other reasons were due to the weather.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Shona Robison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Despite a challenging winter for the NHS and severe weather in early March, our winter contingency planning with health boards saw more operations take place in March than February, up 7.3% to 25,399. The efforts of health and social care staff were tremendous and I am extremely grateful for their ongoing commitment to deliver exemplary care.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Severe weather and warnings not to travel did mean many staff could not get to hospital, and this level of disruption takes hospitals time to recover from. Despite that, on average 820 operations a day took place and feedback from Boards has shown that the clear majority of cancellations for capacity or non-clinical reasons in March was due to the adverse weather.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have always made clear to boards that patients with the greatest clinical need, such as cancer patients, should not have their operations cancelled.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Scotland has become the first country in the world to implement minimum unit pricing for alcohol.</p>
              <p>New legislation brought into force sets a minimum 50 pence per unit price to tackle the damage caused by cheap, high strength alcohol.</p>
              <p>Research shows that the move is expected to save 392 lives in the first five years of implementation.</p>
              <p>Speaking during a visit to a hospital ward treating patients with chronic liver problems, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am extremely proud that the eyes of the world will once again be on Scotland with the introduction of this legislation.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our action is bold and it is brave, and shows once again that we are leading the way in introducing innovative solutions to public health challenges.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no secret that Scotland has a troubled relationship with alcohol. There are, on average, 22 alcohol-specific deaths every week in Scotland, and 697 hospital admissions and behind every one of these statistics is a person, a family, and a community badly affected by alcohol misuse.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Given the clear and proven link between consumption and harm, minimum unit pricing is the most effective and efficient way to tackle the cheap, high strength alcohol that causes so much damage to so many families.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We know we need to act now to change people&rsquo;s attitudes towards alcohol and I am confident that, with the introduction of minimum unit pricing, we are moving in the right direction. Alcohol misuse costs Scotland &pound;3.6 billion each year &ndash; that&rsquo;s &pound;900 for every adult in the country.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland has the highest rate of alcohol-related deaths in the UK &ndash; &nbsp;from today, I hope we will see that change.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Chief Medical Officer Dr Catherine Calderwood said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As a nation we drink 40 per cent more than the low risk drinking guidelines of 14 units per week for men and women. Prior to the implementation of minimum unit pricing, those 14 units could be bought for just &pound;2.52. This is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;That is where this new legislation comes in, and I am confident that over the first five years of its operation, minimum unit pricing will reduce the number of alcohol-specific deaths by hundreds, and hospital admissions by thousands.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The Queensferry Crossing, a new hospital and major motorway improvements are among &pound;3 billion worth of infrastructure projects completed in Scotland last year.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>In addition, major public projects worth &pound;4.1 billion are estimated be in construction during the remainder of 2018, including the second phase of the A9 dualling, the Highland Main Line Phase 2 rail scheme, and key health projects in Clydebank, Greenock and Glasgow.</p>
              <p>Details of the projects are in the annual progress report on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure Investment Plan. The report says that in addition to these, there are separately funded projects such as 50,000 affordable homes, expansion of early learning and childcare, continued superfast broadband roll-out and City Region Deals being taken forward this year.</p>
              <p>Commenting on the report while visiting the new &pound;37.8 million Stirling Health and&nbsp;Care Village construction site, Economy Secretary Keith Brown said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have made excellent progress on our infrastructure plan, and this is good for jobs, good for the economy and good for Scotland overall. Last year we completed key projects such as the Queensferry Crossing, improvements to the M8, M73 and M74, and the new Dumfries &amp; Galloway Royal Infirmary.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This year we expect further significant projects will be completed, including the A90 Aberdeen Western Peripheral route, the electrification of the Stirling-Dunblane-Alloa rail line and the V&amp;A Museum of Design in Dundee. I look forward to seeing these completed, and the people of Scotland and Scottish companies continuing to benefit from this Government&rsquo;s record levels of investment.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Improved nursing care provided closer to home will be made available &ndash; thanks to almost &pound;7 million being invested in training.</p>
              <p>The funding will ensure the existing nurse workforce have the skills &nbsp;to even better meet the needs of people requiring care in their own homes, GP practices or in other community settings<strong>. </strong></p>
              <p>The new Primary Care Workforce Plan sets out commitments to significantly expand and strengthen primary care across Scotland and prepare against the challenges of Brexit in NHS Scotland.</p>
              <p>Following the introduction of the new GP contract, the plan emphasises the importance of highly skilled multi-disciplinary teams to ensure all patients continue to receive high quality care.</p>
              <p>It also outlines plans to support the recruitment of an additional 800 GPs over the next ten years, plus an annual investment of &pound;35 million by 2022 for an extra 800 mental health workers in key locations such as A&amp;E departments, GP practices, police stations and prisons.</p>
              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;A strong and professional workforce is at the centre of the success of Scotland&rsquo;s health and social system. The investment in nurse training will mean that more patients are treated in the community and ensure the sustainability of a multi-disciplinary team approach.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland is leading the way on workforce planning and I am proud that we are the first nation in the UK to publish a plan that not only puts community care at its heart, but also helps prepare us for the expected challenges Brexit may bring for our workforce.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Theresa Fyffe, RCN Scotland Director, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;RCN Scotland is pleased that the Scottish Government has listened to our concerns and that this plan reflects the need for a new approach to developing multi-professional primary care teams. We welcome the recognition that district nurses, advanced nurse practitioners and practice nurses are essential in providing safe, high quality care in our communities and to the overall success of primary care services.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The commitment to investing &pound;6.9 million over three years for the education and training of general practice nurses and district nurses is a move in the right direction. We will continue to work with the Scottish Government to support the development of plans for further investment to grow the community nursing workforce, and district nurses in particular, to meet the needs of patients and shift the balance of care from hospitals and into our communities. We look forward to seeing the detail of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this by September.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
              <p>The report is available on the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2018/04/3662">Scottish Government website</a>.</p>

              <p>New funding of &pound;1 million will help employers with support and advice to enable more disabled people to move into work, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced.</p>
              <p>Disabled people make up 20% of Scotland&rsquo;s population, but only 11% of the private sector workforce and 11.7% of public sector staff.</p>
              <p>The funding will help:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>promote the benefits to employers of recruiting disabled people as part of a more diverse workforce.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>encourage employers to support disabled people through offering work experience, paid internships and more access to Modern Apprenticeships.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>ensure employers &ndash; particularly those in SMEs - have access to up to date, accurate advice and support when seeking to recruit disabled people.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The First Minister also announced a consultation on setting public sector bodies targets for employing disabled people. This will be followed by a Disability Employment Action Plan in autumn 2018 containing measures to support many more disabled people into work.</p>
              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am determined that we use all the levers we have across Scotland to address the inequality disabled people face in the workforce. Far too many who want to work are denied this opportunity.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This investment of &pound;1 million will provide additional support and advice to help meet our ambitions of increasing the number of disabled people who are employed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Disabled people have a right to work and our new devolved employment service, Fair Start Scotland will prioritise support for disabled people and treat them with the dignity and respect to which they are entitled&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>A public sector consultation on the recruitment of disabled people will run from 30 April to 15 August 2018.</p>

              <p>More affordable homes will be delivered across Scotland this year following a &pound;35 million increase to council allocations, bringing it to &pound;568 million.</p>
              <p>The increases will continue over the coming years, rising to &pound;591 million in 2019-20 and &pound;630 million in 2020-21.</p>
              <p>This brings the overall funding allocated to councils for affordable housing to &pound;1.79 billion over three years.</p>
              <p>Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Affordable housing is about more than just bricks and mortar &ndash; it provides safe, warm homes, helps create a fairer Scotland, and delivers great economic benefits.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Statistics show we have delivered almost 72,500 affordable homes since 2007, and we are on track to deliver at least 50,000 over this Parliament, backed by over &pound;3 billion. That is the single biggest investment in, and delivery of, affordable housing since devolution and I am determined to see it benefit all parts of Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We will work in partnership with councils and housing associations to deliver quality homes to meet local needs. This investment backs up our ambitions with financial certainty, meaning councils can plan homes now, with a guarantee of increased funding each year.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Cllr Elena Whitham, COSLA Community Wellbeing Spokesperson, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Councils and our partners locally are working hard to deliver significant increases in affordable houses across Scotland this year. They recognise good quality affordable housing as the cornerstone of building strong and resilient communities.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Good housing contributes to many outcomes local government is seeking to improve &ndash; ultimately creating a fairer and more equal society. The increase in funding for the affordable supply programme is welcomed. Also welcomed is the financial certainty up to 2020-21, which makes planning activity much easier. This is a good example of longer term financial planning.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Full details of the <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/more-homes/affordable-housing-supply/">Affordable Housing Supply Programme budget</a>, and the three year allocations for councils, can be found online. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>In 2018-19, more than &pound;756 million will be made available through the Affordable Housing Supply Programme &ndash; 28% higher than the previous year. As part of this, councils will benefit from an extra &pound;35 million on previously announced funding for affordable housing. The remaining investment will fund national schemes, including support for first time buyers and increasing rural and island housing.</p>

              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced funding for a new collaboration between young people in Malawi and Scotland to support action on climate change.</p>
              <p>Speaking at Scotland&rsquo;s 2050 Climate Group Youth Summit in Glasgow, the First Minister announced support for the group to work with the Malawi Scotland Partnership.</p>
              <p>The collaboration will draw on the knowledge of the 2050 Group to support young people in Malawi to tackle climate change in the future.</p>
              <p>The 2050 Group will support and advise their Malawian counterparts based on their experience gained in Scotland, with the Malawi Scotland Partnership establishing and coordinating on the ground. To assist with this work the Scottish Government will provide up to &pound;50,000 in funding this year.</p>
              <p>The First Minister said: &ldquo;The 2050 Climate Group and Young Leaders Development Programme do fantastic work empowering our young leaders to support the delivery of a just, low carbon future.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am pleased that with Scottish Government support it is now possible to expand their efforts, to work in partnership with young people in Malawi through the Malawi Scotland Partnership on the need for global climate action.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is especially fitting that we are able to make this announcement in 2018, our Year of Young People, and when we have just been honoured with a visit from the President of Malawi.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The 2050 Climate Group is a group of young leaders aged 18-35 which aims to engage, educate and empower future leaders in Scotland to lead transformational change towards a low carbon Scotland.</p>
              <p>The group began as a joint project between Young Scot and the 2020 Climate Group to make young leaders in Scotland &lsquo;2050 Ambassadors&rsquo;. This group of young leaders then became the 2050 Climate Group.</p>

              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s commitment to collaboration within education is impressive, the International Council of Education Advisers (ICEA) have said.</p>
              <p>The implementation of Regional Improvement Collaboratives and appointment of Regional Improvement leads is welcome &ndash; and progress has been swift. Next steps should focus on developing further shared understandings and ensuring practice underpinned by evidence continues to be developed.</p>
              <p>The Council conducted two days of discussion in Inverness, focused on the three priority areas they have previously identified as key to delivering further improvements in Scottish education &ndash; what works educationally to close the attainment gap; capacity building in education leadership; and building collaboration and collective responsibility.</p>
              <p>In a joint statement the Council members said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We continue to be impressed by the direction of travel within Scottish education. Our first trip outwith the central belt has given us another great opportunity to see the system in action from a range of perspectives and we would like to thank the staff and students involved in both days of activity for their warm welcome.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In particular the implementation of the Regional Improvement Collaboratives is a very welcome development since our last visit. We have spoken previously about structure, culture and capacity. With the appropriate structure now in place we would encourage the focus to now move to attending to issues of culture and capacity.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There are already some interesting examples where collaboration is working well but we are clear that collaboration in itself is not enough to bring about the changes that are needed. Education professionals in Scotland need to not only share best practice but ensure they continue to develop new practice which is underpinned by the best evidence to ensure excellence and equity for all.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The ICEA will now draft a final report to the Scottish Government, informed by their previous four visits, setting out the detailed actions it believes will help the Scottish Government deliver the best possible outcomes.</p>
              <p>Deputy First Minister John Swinney said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland is extremely fortunate to have access to the extensive experience of our International Council of Education Advisers. In our efforts to create a world-class education system that delivers excellence and equity for all, their advice and insight is an extremely powerful and trusted, independent resource.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I would like to thank them for giving up their time to offer their invaluable expertise and a wide range of perspectives on the improvements we have made so far and I look forward to receiving their final report which will include further recommendations on how we can continue to ensure Scottish education goes from strength to strength, delivering the best possible start in life for every child regardless of their background.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>More information on the International Council of Education Advisers is available <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/groups/international-council-of-education-advisers/">on the Scottish Government website</a>.</p>

              <p>Almost a billion pounds will be invested annually to fund the huge expansion of early learning and childcare, transforming the life chances of children in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Following extensive engagement to reach a shared understanding of the costs of the expansion, Scottish Ministers and COSLA Leaders have reached agreement on a multi-year funding package.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>This will see the Scottish Government invest by 2021-22 an additional&nbsp;&pound;567 million&nbsp;per year to ensure that every child can access 1140 hours of fully funded early learning and childcare, bringing total annual public spend on early learning and childcare to around&nbsp; &pound;990 million.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>In addition, the Scottish Government will provide councils with total capital funding of &pound;476 million over four years to support associated buildings projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Childcare Minister Maree Todd, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;With thanks to councils the expansion plans are now well underway and will be backed by almost one billion pounds of annual public investment by 2021-22. I am delighted that we have reached agreement on funding with our partners in COSLA, reflecting the importance of this policy priority.&nbsp;This is great news for children and families across Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is a landmark agreement, which marks the culmination of more than two years of hard work to establish a robust shared understanding of the costs attached to the expansion. I am grateful to all those in local authorities who have worked tirelessly to prepare expansion plans and cost estimates.&nbsp; As we now move into a delivery phase, I look forward to continuing to work closely with our partners in local government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Making sure that&nbsp;all children get the best possible start in life is a key priority for this Government and the evidence tells us that if our early learning and childcare offer is to help give children the best start in life and contribute to closing the poverty-related attainment gap, it has to be of high quality. That is why we are determined to get this right and ensure that the right amount of funding is in place.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>COSLA&rsquo;s Resources Spokesperson Councillor Gail Macgregor said:&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is a landmark agreement between the two spheres of government in Scotland.&nbsp; Local government is fully committed to early learning and childcare expansion to 1140 hours. COSLA and Scotland&rsquo;s Council Leaders are fully behind the policy.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s agreement by Council Leaders in agreeing the multi- year funding deal is a culmination of months of hard work, negotiation and real partnership working behind the scenes.&nbsp; We needed to get this policy right from the start, together with the level of funding. I think we have achieved this by working together.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>COSLA&rsquo;s Education Spokesperson Councillor Stephen McCabe added:&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In my role as COSLA&rsquo;s Children and Young people Spokesperson my main objective is to ensure that every child in Scotland is offered the best possible start in life, today&rsquo;s agreement sets us down this road.&nbsp; This is a bold deal between national and local government on a transformational policy that will be beneficial for the young people of Scotland.&nbsp; It would be good if, going forward, we could replicate the joint working that we have achieved in this policy area across the board.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>People and organisations who responded to a healthy weight consultation overwhelmingly supported Scottish Government plans to restrict the marketing of unhealthy food and drink.</p>
              <p>Eight out of ten respondents to a consultation on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s draft diet and healthy weight strategy agreed with restrictions on non-broadcast advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar. There was also backing for a ban on broadcast advertising before the 9pm watershed, and strong support in responses for restrictions on price promotions.</p>
              <p>Respondents from the food and drink industry favoured measures on consumer education.</p>
              <p>Respondents also gave focus on the causes of health inequalities and for links with areas such as physical activity, transport, mental health and alcohol use.</p>
              <p>Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Obesity harms people&rsquo;s health and it is clear we must take decisive action to end our nation&rsquo;s damaging relationship with junk food. The responses to our plans show that people across Scotland agree and want to see strong leadership to support healthier choices by tackling factors that contribute to poor diets, such as the marketing of unhealthy food.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our plans for diet and healthy weight will sit alongside complementary strategies also being published this summer addressing other key priorities in improving health and tackling inequality, such as tobacco, physical activity, substance misuse and alcohol. Taking a multi-pronged approach will make a real and lasting difference to the country&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
              <p>The analysis report is available on the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/ISBN/9781788517164">Scottish Government website</a></p>
              <p>The consultation ran from 26 October 2017 to 31 January 2018, and received 362 responses (183 organisations and 179 individuals). The Government&rsquo;s new strategy will be set out this summer.</p>

              <p>A team of young people are aiming to improve mental health services by leading a study, commissioned by the Scottish Government, drawing on their own experiences.</p>
              <p>The 22 members of the Youth Commission on Mental Health Services begin work this week to reshape the support available, in a partnership between the Scottish Government, Young Scot and the Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH).</p>
              <p>The Youth Commission will gather evidence on existing services, encourage debate among young people and develop recommendations for ministers&nbsp;and service providers&nbsp;on how child and adolescent mental health services can be improved.</p>
              <p>It is part of the 10 year Mental Health Strategy launched last year and mental health is a key theme of the Year of Young People 2018.</p>
              <p>Mental Health Minister Maureen Watt said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is vital that we recognise that good mental wellbeing is as important as physical health and periods of ill mental health can be recovered from with treatment and support. The work of the young commissioners will guide how we improve the mental health services available to young people, and just as importantly, I want the discussion around their work to break down the unjustified stigma that persists around seeking treatment or experiencing poor mental health.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is the Year of Young People 2018 and this commission gives us an opportunity to deliver real change, based on evidence and experience, and create a society and health service that better meets the mental and physical health needs of our children and young people.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Youth Commissioner Hannah (17) said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I see mental health as one piece of the puzzle that makes up all of a person&rsquo;s wellbeing. Throughout my life I&rsquo;ve faced challenges with my mental health and getting support which has made me eager to see what can be done to improve access to mental health services. Many people close to me also deal with mental health issues and so I know how important and wonderful it is to build a support network.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is an opportunity to make a difference in a system that so many people in my community rely on.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>A Bill allowing the Scottish Government to make the first social security payments later this year has been passed by Parliament.</p>
              <p>A unanimous vote means MSPs have passed the Social Security (Scotland) Bill establishing Scotland&rsquo;s first social security system.</p>
              <p>Social Security Scotland, the new agency, will be responsible for the delivery of 11 devolved benefits to 1.4 million people a year, worth around &pound;3.3 billion.</p>
              <p>Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is a historic moment, one that sets up a new public service for Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our system will be different. It will be rights based, with a right to independent advocacy for those who need it; fast-tracked arrangements and no arbitrary timescale for people with terminal illness; the right to have a supporter and the right to challenge decisions without having your money instantly cut.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Now we turn to the work already underway to enable us to deliver. By the end of the summer the first Scottish payments will be being made with our 13% increase to Carers Allowance, we have our interim headquarters and are recruiting the first staff.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Many people and organisations have played their part in creating this Bill and we are grateful to them all. It is a milestone piece of legislation, which provides the foundation for a social security service built on dignity, fairness and respect.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe Michael Russell has said the UK Government&rsquo;s amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill make it &ldquo;crystal clear in terms never seen before that the Scottish Parliament can be over-ridden by the UK Government&rdquo;, if the parliament decides not to give consent to an order constraining its powers.</p>
              <p>The amendments allow the UK Government to stop the Scottish Parliament passing laws in devolved areas for up to seven years without securing its agreement, &ldquo;undermining devolution&rdquo; Mr Russell said.</p>
              <p>The Minister commented:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These amendments will make it easier than ever before for the&nbsp; UK Government to constrain the Scottish Parliament and undermine devolution.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This bill allows the UK Government to prevent the Scottish Parliament legislating to protect farmers, our fishing communities, the environment, and a range of other devolved policy areas for up to seven years.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Bizarrely, a vote by the Parliament expressly refusing to have its powers constrained in this way will actually be the trigger the UK Government needs to constrain those very same powers.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Any decision the Parliament makes can be used by Westminster to overrule it. This is a betrayal of the convention that Westminster will &lsquo;not normally&rsquo; legislate in devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is now crystal clear in terms never seen before that the Scottish Parliament can be over-ridden by the UK Government &ndash; not just on the withdrawal bill, but on a range of Brexit issues.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is now for those who believe we should accept these amendments to set out why they are happy to allow the Scottish Parliament to be undermined in such a way.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We will continue to talk with the UK Government to see if a solution can be agreed. That can either be a removal of clause 11 so that all the governments of the UK proceed on the basis of trust and agreement or the EU Withdrawal Bill can be amended so that the consent of the Scottish Parliament is required before the powers of the Parliament can be constrained.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Proposals which would require all sports coaches working with children and other vulnerable groups to undergo mandatory disclosure checks have been outlined.</p>
              <p>Disclosure Scotland published a consultation to review Scotland&rsquo;s disclosure regime, including the Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) scheme, which covers those working with children and the vulnerable.</p>
              <p>Proposals include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Simplifying the disclosure system</li>
              <li>Making membership of the PVG scheme mandatory for those in sensitive roles</li>
              <li>Making PVG membership time‑limited</li>
              <li>Making the disclosure system respond better to young people&rsquo;s circumstances</li>
              <li>Using digital technology to better and more efficiently meet customer needs</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The consultation will run for 12 weeks.</p>
              <p>Minister for Childcare and Early Years Maree Todd said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have a duty to make Scotland a fair and safe society, supporting people into work, protecting children and those in receipt of medical or care services.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Establishing the PVG scheme in 2011, the Scottish Parliament created a forward-thinking disclosure regime to balance safeguarding individual rights with respect for their private life.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These new proposals will allow Disclosure Scotland to improve its services to customers, simplifying and modernising our disclosure system so that it&rsquo;s fit for a digital future, whilst continuing to ensure people receive the best possible protection.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I encourage all organisations and individuals who are involved with disclosure to give us their feedback.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The full consultation is available on the <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/disclosure-scotland/protection-of-vulnerable/">Scottish Government&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>

              <p>Provisional figures from Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) reveal 4,540 bankruptcy awards for the year 2017-18, down on the 4,562 awarded for the previous year.</p>
              <p>However, total personal insolvencies, which include both bankruptcies and protected trust deeds (PTDs), rose slightly by 4.7%, driven by an increase in PTDs. There were 5,963 PTDs in 2017-18.</p>
              <p>There were welcome signs people struggling with debt in Scotland are seeking to regain control of their finances with a 4.0% increase in the number of debt payment programmes approved under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s pioneering Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS). Throughout 2017-18, 2,322 DAS debt payment programmes were approved helping those in debt to take control, without facing insolvency and protected from further action being taken against them.</p>
              <p>The number of DAS programmes completed rose to 1,681 from 1,603 in 2016-17, a 4.9% increase. A total of &pound;37.6 million was repaid through the scheme last year.</p>
              <p>Commenting on the latest figures, Scottish Government Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy Paul Wheelhouse said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These provisional figures from Accountant in Bankruptcy very much appear to be in line with the UK-wide picture, for personal and company insolvency numbers.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The number of individuals entering insolvency continues to be lower than 10 years ago.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;However, we are under no illusion that, for some people, insolvency is the only means by which they can get a fresh start from the unmanageable burden of their debts, particularly those financially vulnerable families impacted the hardest by the UK Government&rsquo;s cruel and unnecessary austerity agenda.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Here in Scotland, we are working hard to be at the forefront of debt relief policy across the world and we will shortly be seeking to introduce further measures to widen the access to our successful Debt Arrangement Scheme.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;DAS has already helped repay over &pound;200 million of debts owed, while removing any fears of creditor challenge or racking up further interest and charges. Future changes to DAS we have planned will make it even more flexible and appealing to those suffering problem debt.</p>
              <p>The number of Scots businesses closing their doors rose slightly in 2017-18 compared to the previous year, with 886 corporate insolvencies recorded, a 4.7% rise from 846 throughout 2016-17.</p>
              <p>The Minister added: &ldquo;The economic environment our industries are competing in remains a challenging one and this is reflected in the numbers of companies which have been forced out of business.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I will do all I can to safeguard our key industries in Scotland and lessen the financial impact on our communities caused when employers close.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our businesses are facing enormous challenges and uncertainty. Despite these pressures, corporate insolvencies are in line with the trend in recent years.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The figures from AiB show the number of personal and corporate insolvencies for the fourth quarter of 2017-18. During the quarter between January and March 2018, there were 2,501 personal insolvencies, down 0.6% on the 2,516 reported in the same quarter a year ago.</p>
              <p>This figure was made up of 1,038 bankruptcies, down from the 1,116 in quarter four of 2016-17 and 1,463 protected trust deeds, an increase of 63 from the same quarter a year ago.</p>
              <p>There were 259 corporate insolvencies in the quarter, up from 155. However, corporate insolvencies in the fourth quarter of 2016-17 were abnormally low, indicating a return to levels seen in previous years.</p>
              <p>A total of 490 approved debt payment programmes under DAS in the quarter, with a total of &pound;9.3 million paid through the scheme.</p>

              <p>New practical guidance for universities to tackle gender-based violence on campus has been published.</p>
              <p>Guidance and training for staff, better data collection and well-publicised support information for students are some of the recommendations set out in the toolkit, which has been produced by the University of Strathclyde and funded by the Scottish Government.</p>
              <p>The toolkit, which will be adapted for colleges, takes forward the principles set out in the #emilytest campaign set up by Fiona Drouet, in memory of her daughter Emily.</p>
              <p>An additional &pound;396,000 of Scottish Government funding will support the roll-out and implementation of the toolkit.</p>
              <p>Further and Higher Education Minister Shirley-Anne Somerville said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Universities and colleges have a duty to foster a culture on campus that is clear in its condemnation of gender-based violence and gives staff and students the confidence to report unacceptable behaviour.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;That is why I have made the adoption of the policies and procedures outlined in this toolkit a key feature of my Letter of Guidance to the sector this year. I know universities and colleges are up for the challenge and I am keen to see this commitment translate into real, demonstrable action and change for women living, working and researching on campus.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Fiona Drouet said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The launch of the toolkit, along with the Ministerial letter of guidance to the Scottish Funding Council, is a significant turning point with regards to gender-based violence on campus. It is a very important day for all Scottish students.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is Emily&rsquo;s legacy and I hope both staff and students will feel empowered by this resource. Institutions now have the help they need to pass the #emilytest and I believe that had this been in place while our daughter was at university it could have saved her life.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t help Emily but the #emilytest can save others - a legacy Emily would be proud of.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Dr Veena O&rsquo;Halloran, the University of Strathclyde&rsquo;s Secretary and Compliance Officer, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Universities are well-placed to take a leading role in tackling gender-based violence wherever it may occur, through research, teaching and knowledge exchange. As a socially-progressive University, Strathclyde aims to be at the forefront of this work.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are delighted that the Equally Safe in Higher Education toolkit is being made available to universities across the country. We are determined that Scotland has an environment where every student has equal access to help and support, and where university communities &ndash; staff, students and alumni -&nbsp; tackle gender-based violence head-on.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/schoolofsocialworksocialpolicy/equallysafeinhighereducation/eshetoolkit/">Equally Safe in Higher Education Toolkit</a> recommends that each university:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>develops a strategy and implementation plan to tackle gender-based violence.</li>
              <li>establishes a Strategic Group to oversee the implementation of the strategy and appoint a named champion or coordinator to report on progress.</li>
              <li>introduces guidance and training for staff in responding to disclosures of gender-based violence and supporting victims/survivors.</li>
              <li>develops a secure data collection system to record incidences of gender-based violence and undertakes research to ensure the extent and nature of the issue on campus is fully understood.</li>
              <li>ensures well-publicised points of contact for students reporting gender-based violence</li>
              <li>introduces policies for staff and students, including a clearly established code of conduct, disciplinary procedures and sanctions for perpetrators of gender-based violence</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The University of Strathclyde received over &pound;600,000 of funding over two years from the Violence Against Women and Girls Justice Budget to pilot a 2 year project to develop an Equally Safe in Higher Education Toolkit for preventing gender-based violence within higher education institutions (&pound;292,729 in 2016-17, and &pound;311,231 in 2017-18).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Toolkit was developed at University of Strathclyde in close collaboration with a range of external partners and stakeholders including, Police Scotland, NUS Scotland, Glasgow and Clyde Rape Crisis Centre, ASSIST Glasgow, Zero Tolerance Scotland,&nbsp; Glasgow Violence Against Women Partnership, Scottish Women&rsquo;s Rights Centre and cottish Women&rsquo;s Aid.</p>
              <p>The Emily Test Petition was set up after Mrs Drouet&rsquo;s daughter, Emily, a student at the University of Aberdeen, took her own life in March 2016. The campaign calls for increased Scottish Government funding for colleges and universities to support students affected by gender based violence (GBV).</p>

              <p>Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) today released official statistics reporting personal and company insolvencies in Scotland for the fourth quarter (January to March 2018) of 2017-18 and provisional estimates for the 2017-18 financial year.</p>
              <p><strong>Scottish insolvency statistics in 2017-18 </strong></p>
              <p>Provisional estimates show that in 2017-18 personal insolvencies in Scotland increased by 4.7% to 10,503 from 10,032 in 2016-17. Estimates for 2017-18</p>
              <p>are provisional until final figures are published in July 2018.</p>
              <p>Personal insolvencies (bankruptcies and protected trust deeds (PTDs)) rose for the second consecutive year but remain below levels seen between 2005-06 and 2014-15.</p>
              <p>The increase in personal insolvencies in 2017-18 was due to PTDs, which increased by 9.0% on the previous year.</p>
              <p>In 2017-18, there were 2,322 debt payment programmes (DPPs) approved under the Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS), 89 more than a year earlier. In 2017-18, &pound;37.6 million was repaid from debtors under DAS compared with &pound;37.3 million in 2016-17.</p>
              <p>Corporate insolvencies increased from 846 in 2016-17 to 886 in 2017-18.</p>
              <p><strong>Scottish Insolvency Statistics for January to March 2018 (2017-18 Q4) </strong></p>
              <p>There were 2,501 personal insolvencies in Scotland in 2017-18 Q4, similar to the 2,516 personal insolvencies in the quarter in the previous year (2016-17 Q4).</p>
              <p>There were 1,038 bankruptcies awarded during this quarter, a 7.0% decrease on the same quarter in 2016-17. PTDs increased by 4.5% to 1,463 over the same period.</p>
              <p>There were 490 DPPs approved under DAS compared with 531 in the same quarter of 2016-17.</p>
              <p>A total of &pound;9.3 million was repaid through DAS during this quarter, compared with &pound;9.2 million in 2016-17 Q4.</p>
              <p>The number of Scottish registered companies becoming insolvent or entering receivership increased in the fourth quarter of 2017-18, with 259 companies becoming insolvent compared with 155 in 2016-17 Q4. There were 119 members&rsquo; voluntary liquidations (solvent liquidations), the same as in 2016-17 Q4.</p>
              <p>The figures released today were produced in accordance with the professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>

              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician today published the salmon and sea trout fishery statistics for the 2017 season.</p>
              <p><strong>Salmon</strong></p>
              <p>Total reported rod catch (retained and released) for 2017 is 49,444. This is the fourth lowest on record and 80% of the previous 5-year average.</p>
              <p>The proportion of the rod catch accounted for by catch and release is among the highest reported since these figures were first recorded in 1994. In 2017, 98% of rod caught spring salmon was released, as was 90% of the annual rod catch.</p>
              <p>Trends in rod catch vary among individual stock components. Reported catch of spring salmon shows a general decline since records began in 1952 and, although there is some indication that catch has stabilised in recent years, it remains at a historically low level. Overall catch of salmon and grilse in later months, on the other hand, showed a general increase up to 2010, after which it fell sharply over the next 4 years before recovering slightly in 2015 and 2016 only to fall again in 2017.<br /> <br />Reported catch and effort for both fixed engine and net &amp; coble fisheries are the among the lowest since records began in 1952.</p>
              <p>Salmon and grilse reported as being of farmed origin represented 1% of the total Scottish catch in 2017. These catches are among the highest reported since records began in 1994. 96% of these catches were reported from the west coast region and coincided with a reported escape of salmon from a farm in the area.&emsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Sea Trout</strong></p>
              <p>The total reported rod catch of sea trout (retained and released) for 2017 is 18,296. Catches have declined over much of the period since 1952, when our records began. In 2017, they were the fourth lowest on record and 90% of the previous 5-year average.</p>
              <p>The proportion of the rod catch accounted for by catch and release in 2017 is 84%, the highest reported since these figures were first recorded in 1994.</p>
              <p>Catch and effort for both fixed engine and net &amp; coble fisheries are among the lowest since records began in 1952.</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The data have been collected and collated by Marine Scotland Science and the Salmon and Sea Trout Fishery Statistics for 2017 can be <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/marine/science/Publications/stats/SalmonSeaTroutCatches">accessed.&nbsp;</a></p>
              <p>The publication provides a summary of rod and net catch together with net fishing effort for the 2017 fishing season. It is based on returns from proprietors, occupiers or agents of salmon and sea trout fisheries throughout Scotland.</p>
              <p>The statistics for the 2017 season are a summary of the data from 1963 forms returned from 2116 forms issued (93% return rate). Final published statistics for the previous 10 years have been based on return rates of forms between 93% and 95%.</p>

              <p>Tha cha mh&ograve;r 900 sgoilear a-nis cl&agrave;raichte sna sgoiltean G&agrave;idhlig ann an Glaschu aig Gleann D&agrave;il agus Sr&agrave;id Berkeley, agus an d&agrave; sgoil a-nis cho l&agrave;n &rsquo;s a ghabhas.</p>
              <p>A&rsquo; bruidhinn &agrave;s d&egrave;idh deasbad mu dheidhinn am Plana C&agrave;nain N&agrave;iseanta G&agrave;idhlig 2018-23, thuirt Leas Phr&igrave;omh Mhinistear John Swinney:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Tha f&agrave;s ann am foghlam G&agrave;idhlig air a bhith gu math soirbheachail air feadh Alba, agus tha an cothrom againn a-nis an soirbheachas sin a thoirt air adhart nas luaithe. Tha Comhairle Baile Ghlaschu air a bhith na f&igrave;or dheagh eisimpleir a thaobh foghlam G&agrave;idhlig, agus le bhith st&egrave;idheachadh treas sgoil Gh&agrave;idhlig fa leth, faodaidh iad an cothrom a thoirt do bharrachd ph&agrave;rantan a tha ag iarraidh foghlam G&agrave;idhlig dhan chlann aca.&nbsp; Dh&rsquo;fhosgail Bun-sgoil Gh&agrave;idhlig Phort R&igrave;gh an t-seachdain sa chaidh &ndash; an t-siathamh sgoil den t-se&ograve;rsa ann an Alba &ndash; agus a&rsquo; dol air adhart cumaidh sinn ar taic agus brosnachadh ri f&agrave;s ann am foghlam G&agrave;idhlig.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Chuir Chris Cunningham, Neach-gairm a&rsquo; Bhaile airson Foghlam, Sgilean &amp; Tr&agrave;th-bhliadhnaichean f&agrave;ilte air a&rsquo; mhaoineachadh, ag r&agrave;dh:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Thig brosnachadh m&ograve;r bhon leudachadh ann am foghlam tron Gh&agrave;idhlig air feadh Ghlaschu, agus bidh an cothrom aig barrachd theaghlaichean na bh&rsquo; ann riamh an cothrom fhaighinn air G&agrave;idhlig airson an cuid cloinne aig gach &igrave;re, bho sgoil-&agrave;raich suas gu &agrave;rd-sgoil.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Th&egrave;id an ath-thaigh, san togalach far am b&rsquo; &agrave;bhaist do Sgoil Cartvale a bhith, a leasachadh mar eisimpleir eile de ar dealas leantainneach ri FtG agus tha sinn a&rsquo; cur f&agrave;ilte air a&rsquo; mhaoineachadh a bharrachd seo airson leasachaidhean agus ath-nuadhachaidhean airson gun urrainn dhuinn an togalach sgoile &ugrave;r fhosgladh san L&ugrave;nastal 2019.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Tha Riaghaltas na h-Alba dealasach gus d&egrave;anamh cinnteach gum bi a&rsquo; Gh&agrave;idhlig seasmhach ann ann an Alba san &agrave;m ri teachd, agus miann-adhartais aca gun till an &agrave;ireamh de luchd-labhairt ann an cunntas-sluaigh 2021 ris an &igrave;re a bh&rsquo; ann an 2001.</p>

              <p><strong>Third Glasgow Gaelic School</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Deputy First Minister announces &pound;1.9 million investment in project.</strong></p>
              <p>A third Gaelic school is to open in Glasgow as demand for places continues to grow.</p>
              <p>Increased capacity will ensure the local authority can meet demand for Gaelic medium education (GME) in coming years and improve learning opportunities for young people. The new school will be located in the Cartvale area of the city and it is expected to open to pupils in 2019.</p>
              <p>Nearly 900 pupils are enrolled in Glasgow&rsquo;s two existing GME schools at Glendale and Berkeley Street &ndash; both of which are now at capacity.</p>
              <p>Speaking following a debate on the National Gaelic Language Plan 2018-23, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have an opportunity to build on the success of recent years and to ensure a faster rate of progress in the expansion of Gaelic education across Scotland. Glasgow City Council has a remarkable record with Gaelic education and the establishment of a third standalone school will provide capacity to meet growing demand from parents. Following the opening of Portree Gaelic School last week &ndash; the sixth in Scotland &ndash; we will continue to support and encourage the growth of Gaelic education.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Chris Cunningham, City Convener for Education, Skills &amp; Early Years welcomed the grant funding and said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The expansion of Gaelic Medium Education across Glasgow is very exciting and more families than ever before are able to access Gaelic for their children and at all stages through nursery to secondary school.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The development of the former Cartvale School is yet another example of our continued commitment to GME and we welcome the additional grant which will go towards the upgrades and renovations for the opening of the new school building in August 2019.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Funding will be provided from the Gaelic Capital Fund which was set up in 2008 in recognition of the key role of education in increasing the number of Gaelic speakers.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring a sustainable future for <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/languages/gaelic/">Gaelic</a> and has an ambition of returning the number of speakers of the language to those reported in the 2001 census by 2021.</p>

              <p>The UK Government&rsquo;s EU Withdrawal Bill will continue to &ldquo;enable the powers of the Scottish Parliament to be constrained &rdquo; without Parliament&rsquo;s consent unless Clause 11 of the UK Bill is either withdrawn or amended in line with the existing devolved settlement, &nbsp;Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe Michael Russell said today.</p>
              <p>Mr Russell confirmed that following negotiations and progress in a number of areas the issue of parliamentary consent remains unresolved. The First Minister has today written to the Prime Minister setting out the remaining concerns.</p>
              <p>Under amendments expected to be lodged by the UK Government the powers of the Scottish Parliament could be constrained for up to seven years without parliament&rsquo;s consent.</p>
              <p>Indicating that the Scottish Government will publish a legislative consent memorandum later this week highlighting the changes to the EU withdrawal bill and that discussions are expected to continue with the UK Government next week and up to the final reading of the bill, Mr Russell also set out two options that could deliver progress on a solution.</p>
              <p>Mr Russell said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Tomorrow we expect the UK Government to publish further amendments to clause eleven.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have given them serious and respectful consideration but we as a government are absolutely and unanimously clear that we cannot support any proposal that would enable the powers of the parliament to be constrained without the agreement of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;And the UK Government&rsquo;s latest proposals continue to give Westminster the power to prevent the Scottish Parliament from passing laws in certain devolved policy areas and while we expect the amendments to include the addition of a sunset clause the restrictions on our use of these powers would last for up to seven years. While any constraint placed on the UK Government will be purely voluntary.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The effect of the UK Government&rsquo;s latest proposal remains this: the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s powers could be restricted without consent. This is not something the Scottish Government could recommend the Parliament approves.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There are two possible ways forward. The first is to simply remove clause 11 from the bill.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Both the Scottish and UK Governments could then agree, on equal terms, not to bring forward legislation in devolved policy areas while negotiations on frameworks are taking place.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Alternatively, we could agree to abide by the present system. In that system any regulations preventing the Scottish Parliament from legislating in devolved matters for a temporary period of time must only be introduced when that is agreed by the Scottish Parliament.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These are practical, workable solutions to this issue that will ensure the necessary preparations for Brexit can be taken across the UK whilst protecting devolution.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>With one hundred days to go until the beginning of the European Championships in Glasgow, preparations are underway to welcome visitors and spectators to a celebration of sport and culture alongside co-hosts Berlin.</p>
              <p>Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop is in the German capital this week, undertaking engagements that underline the close working between the two cities to deliver in August the first multi-sport European Championships in history alongside a creative and innovative cultural programme.</p>
              <p>Ms Hyslop visited Berlin&rsquo;s Olympic Stadium, where the European Athletics Championships are being staged while Glasgow simultaneously hosts the Championships in aquatics, cycling, gymnastics, golf, rowing and triathlon. She also met the Managing Director of Berlin 2018, the organising committee for the Berlin elements of the event.</p>
              <p>Discussions also took place with The Berlin University of the Arts about opportunities for cultural collaboration that showcase the thriving arts scenes in both cities.</p>
              <p>Ms Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is a great honour for Glasgow and Berlin to co-host the first ever multi-sport European Championships and both cities are working closely together to ensure the success of this exciting and innovative concept.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Of course, the thrilling sporting action will take place alongside a showcase of Scottish and German culture and it is exciting to see this type of exchange between our two countries, strengthening our bonds further.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Both cities can expect to see an influx of spectators enjoying the results of this thriving partnership, helping boost visitor numbers and showcasing our nations, as the event will be broadcast to a potential worldwide audience of more than one billion people.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Berlin 2018 CEO Frank Kowalski said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is an honour for Berlin to be part of the first multi- sport European Championships and to co-operate closely with Glasgow 2018 on all of the cultural and over-arching elements of the programme.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The strong link between Glasgow and Berlin will be seen in Festival 2018 with its centre at Glasgow&rsquo;s George Square and the Berlin 2018 Sport Festival at Breitscheidplatz.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are sure that all spectators, no matter if in Berlin or Glasgow, will feel the spirit of cooperation during this event and throughout The Championships.&rdquo;</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Planning/Publications">Statistics on quarterly planning performance</a> in Scotland have been released today by Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician. These detail the number of planning applications decided across Scotland and average decision times for most types of application including housing and business and industry.</p>
              <p>The overall average decision time for <u>all local</u> applications (9.1 weeks for 6,544 applications) has increased slightly since the previous quarter (9.0 weeks). In addition, there were 429 local developments decided that had processing agreements in place, with 321 (75 per cent) of these meeting agreed timescales.</p>
              <p>The overall average decision time for <u>all major</u> developments (27.7 weeks for 63 applications) was just over five weeks quicker than the previous quarter (33.0 weeks). In addition, there were 21 major applications decided that were subject to processing agreements with 16 (76 per cent) of these meeting agreed timescales.</p>
              <p><strong>Key Findings for Quarter 3 (October to December) of 2017/18:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The overall average decision time for all local applications has increased slightly compared to the previous quarter but is quicker than the equivalent quarter 3 figure for 2016/17.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The average decision time figures presented in this Statistical News Release exclude pre 3rd August 2009 cases and applications concluded through the use of a processing agreement between the developer and the local authority, where an agreement on timescales for decisions can be made either at the beginning of the application process or at a later stage. Also, some applications exclude time periods in which particular delays have been outwith the control of planning authorities.&nbsp; Further information on these types of applications is available in the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Planning/Publications/">full statistical publication.</a></p>
              <p>Local developments include applications for changes to individual houses and smaller developments for new housing as well as applications covering areas of development such as minerals, business &amp; industry, waste management, electricity generation, freshwater fish farming, marine finfish farming, marine shellfish farming, telecommunications, Approval of Matters Specified in Conditions (AMSCs<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>) and other developments.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Major developments include applications for 50 or more homes, as well as certain waste, water, transport and energy-related developments, larger retail developments, and other developments.</p>
              <p>Classification between local and major developments depends on the particular development type. For example, housing developments are classed as major when the application is for 50 or more dwellings or for a site that exceeds two hectares, whereas electricity generation is classed as major when the capacity of the generating station is or exceeds 20 megawatts.</p>
              <p>An <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/planning-architecture/">explanatory document</a> providing background information on the Planning Performance Framework is also available.</p>
              <p>Official statistics are produced in accordance with professional standards &ndash; more information on the standards of official statistics in Scotland can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/About">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/About</a></p>
              <p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Applications for Approval of Matters Specified in Conditions (AMSCs) relate to conditions attached to planning permission in principle requiring the further approval, consent or agreement of the planning authority for any detailed aspect of the development.</p>

              <p>Children with congenital heart defects are amongst those set to benefit from new technology designed to improve diagnoses and treatment planning thanks to investment announced by Economy Secretary Keith Brown.</p>
              <p>Scottish Enterprise has awarded Edinburgh based Canon Medical&rsquo;s European Research and Development Centre &pound;1.9m towards developing its new &pound;6.6m life sciences software. The technology will give medical staff a single &lsquo;cockpit&rsquo; view, quickly pinpointing and collating key patient information from a variety of medical sources to better inform treatment decisions.</p>
              <p>Initially the software will be used by medical staff treating congenital heart defects in children with the potential for it to be developed to support treatment for a wider range of medical conditions in future, including cardiovascular, stroke and oncology patients. The funding will also create 10 new jobs and protect 16 existing posts on the project.</p>
              <p>Economy Secretary Mr Brown said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Developments in life science technologies are hugely welcome in terms of both improving patient care and treatment and growing our economy, as well as further establishing Scotland as a centre of excellence in this important sector.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our aspiration is for Scotland to continue to lead innovations in life sciences and our Programme for Government saw business Research &amp; Development grants boosted by 70%.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scottish Enterprise has worked with Canon Medical over the last 13 years to help achieve its growth ambitions and I look forward to seeing this collaboration continue to flourish and the company expanding its global business here in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Ken Sutherland, President of Canon Medical Research Europe, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland is a fantastic location for us to innovate as we have access to top talent, universities and research collaborators, together with the strong support of the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise. We&rsquo;re actively recruiting staff now to work on this project and hope to continue harnessing the excellent international graduate talent from Scottish universities.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This project comes at a pivotal moment for us, allowing us to evolve into a healthcare data and AI research and development business. This &pound;6.6m project also underlines the confidence our Japanese parent company has in further investing in our Scottish activity.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Rhona Allison, Interim Managing Director at Scottish Enterprise, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Business innovation is critical to the success of our economy. Innovation is a key driver of growth and companies that innovate are more productive, do more international trade and employ more people.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Giving our backing to this Research &amp; Development project means we can help Canon Medical maximise its investment, cement its activity in Scotland and further increase Scotland&rsquo;s reputation as a global hub for life sciences and medical technology excellence. I wish Canon Medical every success with this project and look forward to continuing to work with Ken and his team to grow the company further in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The first of at least 400 jobs, created to deliver devolved social security support within local communities across Scotland, are now open for applications.</p>
              <p>The new Social Security Scotland service will have a presence in every local authority area, with staff co-located in existing public and third sector services &ndash; all of which will make it easily accessible to local communities and anyone looking for information and support.</p>
              <p>Announcing the jobs at Bathgate Partnership Centre, a community hub in West Lothian, Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s new social security system will treat people with dignity, fairness and respect, delivering services in a way that ensures people can get the financial support they are entitled to. This means that people should be able to access the agency in the way that is right for their needs &ndash; be that online, over the phone or face-to-face.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want to make sure people can speak directly to our staff to get the information and advice they need for any one of the 11 benefits we will be responsible for. Our staff working in existing, accessible premises and alongside colleagues in local authorities, health and the third sector will be one of the many distinctly different features of our new social security system.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Parliament will vote on the Social Security Bill tomorrow and I am looking forward to building a new public service that meets the needs of the people of Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>More than 285,000 households in financial difficulty have received Scottish Government grants to help them over the past five years.</p>
              <p>People in low income households have received almost &pound;156 million from the Scottish Welfare Fund since it started in April 2013, including &pound;7.7 million between October and December 2017. A third of the households receiving grants were families with children.</p>
              <p>The majority of SWF awards come from Crisis Grants, which help people who are in need because of emergency or crisis, with around one in eight applications being made because of late or delayed benefit payments.</p>
              <p>The latest figures show that 27,570 Crisis Grants were made between October and December 2017, a 6% increase on the same quarter in 2016.</p>
              <p>Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Welfare Fund provides a vital lifeline, supporting low income households experiencing emergencies and crisis situations. For many, it provides much-needed financial support for the everyday items that no one should be denied simply because of their hardships.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is unacceptable that people find themselves in these situations through no fault of their own. Under UK Government welfare cuts, money is being taken from the pockets of low income families, pushing them into crisis, debt and poverty. The Scottish Welfare Fund is one part of the &pound;100 million we spend annually to try and mitigate that and provide support to the people of Scotland at a time of need.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The most common reason for Crisis Grant applications is emergency need, for example food and heating. This category makes up 83% of applications.</p>
              <p>The SWF also provides Community Care Grants to help vulnerable people set up home or continue to live independently in their community, and families facing exceptional pressure.</p>

              <p>From when the Scottish Welfare Fund scheme began on 1 April 2013 until 31 December 2017, 285,720 individual households have received awards totaling &pound;155.8 million.</p>
              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician today released statistics on the Scottish Welfare Fund covering &nbsp;the period from 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2017. The statistics showed that a third of households receiving a Scottish Welfare Fund award were families with children, while just over half were single person households with no children.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Welfare Fund comprises of Community Care Grants &ndash; which help people to live independently &ndash; and Crisis Grants, which provide a safety net in a disaster or emergency.</p>
              <p>Between 1 October and 31 December 2017, local authorities received 15,240 applications for Community Care Grants, and awarded &pound;5.5 million for items such as floor coverings, furniture and kitchen appliances. During the same quarter, local authorities received 40,115 applications for Crisis Grants, and awarded &pound;2.1 million for items such as food and essential heating costs.</p>
              <p>The annual budget for Scottish Welfare Fund awards in 2017/18 (including underspend from previous years) is &pound;34.4 million. By 31 December, three quarters of the way through the financial year, 69% of this budget had been spent.<strong><br /> </strong></p>

              <p>On 1 April 2013, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) abolished two elements of the Social Fund &ndash; Community Care Grants and Crisis Loans &ndash; and transferred funds previously spent on them to Scottish Ministers. In its place, the Scottish Government established the Scottish Welfare Fund (SWF). The Scottish Welfare Fund is a national scheme run by local authorities, based on <a href="http://scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/welfarereform/scottishwelfarefund/scottishwelfarefuindguidance">guidance</a> from Scottish Ministers. The guidance has been developed in partnership with COSLA, Local Authorities and other stakeholders.</p>

              <p>A survey of over 130,000 people has found that the majority of GP patients and social care users report a positive experience of their care. However, an overarching finding was that respondents were slightly less positive than in previous surveys, in particular about accessing GP services and support for carers.</p>
              <p>Results of the 2017/18 Health and Care Experience Survey were released today by Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician. These figures were produced in accordance with professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>
              <p><strong>GP Practice Access and Care</strong></p>
              <p>Eighty three per cent of people rated the overall care provided by their GP practice positively, this was down two percentage points from the last survey and seven percentage points compared to the first Health and Care Experience survey in 2009/10.</p>
              <p>Ninety three per cent of people were able to obtain two working day access to their GP practice; this is a slight increase from the previous survey.&nbsp; Around two thirds of people were allowed to book an appointment at their GP practice three or more working days in advance &ndash; a significant decrease from the previous survey.</p>
              <p>Eighty seven per cent of people found it easy to contact their GP practice in the way that they want to, although only 67 per cent of people rated the arrangements for getting to see a doctor positively.</p>
              <p>When receiving treatment or advice at a GP practice, people were most positive about understanding the information they were given (95 per cent) and that they were listened to (93 per cent).</p>
              <p><strong>Referrals</strong></p>
              <p>The survey asked people about referrals to other NHS health professionals. Respondents &nbsp;described experiences with a wide range of different health professionals.&nbsp; Seventy eight per cent of people rated the coordination of their treatment / care positively and just over four fifths of people were positive about the care they experienced from the service they were last referred to.</p>
              <p><strong>Out of Hours Care</strong></p>
              <p>In the last year, 45 per cent of people got advice or treatment from an Out of Hours (OOH) service. Most people (83 per cent) were positive about the overall care they had experienced from the service they ended up receiving treatment or advice from. People were most positive about understanding the information they were given and feeling that they were listened to (rated positively by 93 and 92 per cent of people respectively). This is consistent with the most positive aspects of care at the GP practice.</p>
              <p><strong>Care, Support and Help with Everyday Living</strong></p>
              <p>Of those who received formal help and support, 80 per cent rated the overall help, care or support services as either excellent or good. This is slightly lower than the results from the 2015/16 survey and a decrease from 83 per cent in 2013/14.</p>
              <p>As in previous surveys, users of care services were generally positive about some of the person-centred aspects of the care that they received. For example, 87 per cent said that they were treated with compassion and understanding.</p>
              <p>Users of care services were least positive about being aware of the help, care and support options available (73 per cent were positive) and the co-ordination of services (74 per cent). These results are similar to those from the previous survey.</p>
              <p><strong>Experiences of Carers</strong></p>
              <p>The survey indicated that 16 per cent of people look after or provide regular help or support to others. Overall, when asked about specific aspects of caring, people were less positive than they were in previous years.</p>
              <p>Carers were most positive about having a good balance between caring and other activities, with around two thirds agreeing that they did. They were least positive about support to continue caring.&nbsp; Overall, 37 per cent of carers said that they felt supported to continue caring which is a decrease of six percentage points from 2013/14.</p>

              <p>This publication contains results from the 2017/18 Health and Care Experience Survey. Questionnaires were sent to a randomly selected sample of people who were registered with a GP in Scotland in October 2017. The survey asked about people&rsquo;s experiences of accessing and using their GP practice and other local healthcare services; receiving care, support and help with everyday living; and caring responsibilities.</p>
              <p>More information about the survey design is available in the accompanying technical report, which is available at <a href="http://www.gov.scot/ISBN/9781788517676">www.gov.scot/ISBN/9781788517676</a>.</p>
              <p>The survey was commissioned by the Scottish Government, in partnership with ISD Scotland, as part of the Scottish Care Experience programme. The survey fieldwork administration was undertaken by Quality Health Ltd. Individual reports for each GP practice, GP Cluster, Health and Social Care Partnership and NHS Board will be made available via an online dashboard.

              <p>A framework outlining Scotland and Malawi&rsquo;s joint commitment to realising the United Nation&rsquo;s Global Development Goals has been agreed.</p>
              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and President Peter Mutharika of Malawi have signed a partnership agreement to commit both governments to development cooperation across areas such as health, education, human rights, governance and social enterprise.</p>
              <p>The accord comes thirteen years after the governments of Scotland and Malawi first signed a cooperation agreement.</p>
              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland and Malawi have historical and enduring ties of friendship and cooperation. We have committed today to maintain this relationship and partnership in the future.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Thirteen years since our governments first formally approved a development cooperation agreement, I am pleased we have the opportunity to update it to reflect our commitment to the UN Global Goals, and to each other, in the signing of a new Global Goals Partnership Agreement.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;By working together on areas such as environmental sustainability, health improvement and education, we can take steps to improve the lives of those in our countries and further afield.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><u>Background</u></p>
              <p>The President of Malawi is visiting Scotland from 23 - 26 April.</p>
              <p>Supportive quotes:</p>
              <p>Jane Salmonson, Chief Executive of Scotland&rsquo;s International Development Alliance said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is exciting to see the Co-operation Agreement between the Governments of Malawi and Scotland being renewed and brought up to date, especially in the light of the signing of the new Sustainable Development Goals since the first Co-operation Agreement was signed.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I strongly welcome the&nbsp; prominence given to the new Goals in the way the priorities for development co-operation were agreed.&nbsp; This new&nbsp; Agreement exemplifies the way that countries can work together in partnership towards meeting the goals, to create lasting benefits for people and communities in Malawi and in the world that we and they share.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Kenneth Ross, Chair of the Scotland Malawi Partnership, said:</p>
              <p>"The vast range of people-to-people interactions between Scotland and Malawi have created an inspiring new model of international development.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We strongly welcome the commitment of the two Governments to strengthening this unique partnership, now reaffirmed in the renewed &nbsp;Cooperation Agreement being signed today."&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Andrew Namakhoma, Chair of the Malawi Scotland Partnership, said:</p>
              <p>"With the signing of the new Cooperation Agreement comes the assurance of a strong people-to-people model of development which will see the two governments and civil society groups working towards equitable social development. Thanks to the two governments for championing the model."</p>

              <p>Payments worth more than &pound;300 million to farmers and crofters have begun, Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing has confirmed.</p>
              <p>In the coming months, eligible farmers and crofters will receive the final balance of their Common Agricultural Policy Pillar 1 entitlement for the 2017 scheme year, having already received up to 90% through the government&rsquo;s loan scheme in early November.</p>
              <p>Over 18,000 eligible farmers will receive payments under the Common Agricultural Policy&rsquo;s Pillar 1 schemes, that will support investment, jobs and drive the rural economy forward.</p>
              <p>Mr Ewing said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I can confirm that the first tranche of Basic Payment Support, Greening and Young Farmer payments for the 2017 scheme year have now begun.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These payments will see farmers and crofters receive the final balance of payments, following my decision last year to provide a loan scheme worth up to 90% of their entitlement. This decision meant that farmers were paid a higher proportion of their entitlement at an earlier time than ever before, ensuring no eligible farmer who accepted the offer of a loan was out of pocket.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;With further tranches being made in the coming weeks and months, I am confident that the vast majority of farmers and crofters will receive their payments by the end of the payment window, demonstrating my absolute commitment to support our rural business and communities.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The first tranche of Pillar 1 payments are being processed with money due to reach bank accounts from 24 April onwards.</p>

              <p>Around 10,000 more Scots will receive MRI scans every year thanks to two new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners funded by the Scottish Government.</p>
              <p>The &pound;2.4 million awarded to the Golden Jubilee National Hospital (GJNH) for new equipment will reduce waiting times for diagnostics by increasing capacity.</p>
              <p>The hospital has experienced an 88% increase in the number of imaging exams carried out over the last six years, with MRI being one of those continually in demand.</p>
              <p>This development is the first stage of a three year expansion of the hospital, which will also see ophthalmology, orthopaedic and other services increased.</p>

              <p>&ldquo;In a matter of months these two MRIs have carried out 3,500 scans for patients across&nbsp;eight health boards and we hope they will have a significant impact on waiting times across Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is just the start of the expansion of the Golden Jubilee, which is a key part of our commitment to ensure our services meet the health needs of Scotland over the next decade and beyond.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Jill Young, Chief Executive of the Golden Jubilee Foundation, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This direct investment to patient care will not only help us provide NHS Scotland with sustainable services for the future, but will allow us to have an even greater impact in diagnosing, treating and monitoring long term health conditions, including heart disease and cancer.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Background</p>
              <p>Health Boards who have benefited from the scanners are NHS Ayrshire and Arran, NHS Fife, NHS Forth Valley, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Lanarkshire, NHS Dumfries and Galloway, NHS Western Isles, NHS Lothian.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s economic ties with Europe&rsquo;s largest economy have been boosted following the opening of a Scottish Government hub in Berlin.</p>
              <p>The new Germany Innovation and Investment Hub will:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Promote investment between German and Scottish businesses and organisations</li>
              <li>Increase Scottish Government influence and engagement with Germany</li>
              <li>Encourage collaboration between business, research, education and cultural institutions</li>
              <li>Build on Scotland&rsquo;s reputation as a destination of choice to work, study and visit</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Germany is already Scotland&rsquo;s fourth largest overseas market, with exports worth &pound;1.9 billion in 2016. The Germany Hub will complement the wider international network, covering London, Dublin, Brussels, Beijing and Washington DC. The hub will jointly house Scottish Government and Scottish Development International staff and is co-located within the British Embassy.</p>
              <p>External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop announced the opening as she undertook two days of engagements in the German capital. This includes the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Glasgow and Berlin Chambers of Commerce and meeting the organisers of the European Championships, jointly hosted in Glasgow and Berlin this summer.</p>
              <p>Ms Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland is an outward-looking European nation that has much to share with other countries. The opening of our Germany Hub is a signal of our intent to continue to support deep and lasting links with our European neighbours. In light of Brexit, it is all the more important that we deepen those cultural, economic and diplomatic ties.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Germany Innovation and Investment Hub is a significant addition to our hub network, as we seek to foster the conditions and relationships Scottish companies and institutions need to internationalise and grow. Further to that, the Hub will be a focal point for our engagement across the central Europe region.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The new agreement between Glasgow and Berlin Chambers of Commerce is welcome and symbolises the close synergy and opportunities that exist between Scottish and Germany organisations &ndash; as does the close working between the two cities to host the upcoming European Championships.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chambers of Commerce, added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The signing of this agreement could not have come at a more appropriate time, with the uncertainty that the Brexit vote has brought to future trading relationships with Europe.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Glasgow Chamber&rsquo;s Board took the view that, whatever the outcomes from the negotiations, we should do our best to strengthen trading ties wherever we could, and this agreement shows that we are on the front foot in maintaining business links with Europe and not sitting back waiting on others to make decisions.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>In addition to launching the hub, Ms Hyslop&rsquo;s meetings and engagements in Berlin include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Head of the German Parliament Committee for Economy and Energy</li>
              <li>Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry</li>
              <li>Managing Director of the Berlin 2018 European Athletics Championships</li>
              <li>INNOGY innovation hub</li>
              <li>18 Investment Management</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Germany Innovation and Investment Hub is located at Wilhelmstra&szlig;e 70 in central Berlin. The hub will complement the existing Scottish Development International presence in Dusseldorf. A new Twitter account for the hub has launched today: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/scothubgermany">@ScotHubGermany</a></p>
              <p>Key facts on Scottish-German relations:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Around 30,000 German citizens live in Scotland</li>
              <li>There were 354,000 visitors to Scotland from Germany in 2016</li>
              <li>Germany is the third largest source of foreign direct investment into Scotland, with 155 German-owned companies employing nearly 18,000 people</li>
              <li>Germany is Scotland's biggest partner in Europe for academic research collaboration</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Shoppers on Scotland&rsquo;s high streets and retail parks will learn about the symptoms of cervical cancer in a nationwide campaign this summer.</p>
              <p>The &pound;100,000 &lsquo;Be Cervix Savvy&rsquo; campaign will tour Scotland from mid-June, with volunteers from Jo&rsquo;s Cervical Cancer Trust raising awareness of the signs of the disease.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government is funding the campaign as part of the its &pound;100 million Cancer Strategy to improve prevention, detection, treatment and survival rates.</p>
              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are making inroads in tackling cancer but we need to go further and develop innovative approaches that ensure everyone can get the information on screening they need, and raise awareness of the symptoms of cancer.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Cervical cancer is largely preventable and screening is the best way to protect against the disease, yet one in four Scottish women still don&rsquo;t get their regular smear tests.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;That is why this campaign is so important and will help us to catch cancer at the earliest stages.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Robert Music, Chief Executive of Jo&rsquo;s Cervical Cancer Trust, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are delighted that the Scottish Government has funded us to bring our hugely successful Be Cervix Savvy Roadshow to Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Starting in June and travelling over five weeks, we will &nbsp;be speaking to women across Scotland about how they can reduce their risk of cervical cancer. In particular, we hope to save lives by focusing on areas where cervical screening uptake is especially low.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
              <p>Jo&rsquo;s Cervical Cancer Trust is the only UK charity dedicated to women affected by cervical cancer and cervical abnormalities and ran a successful UK wide &lsquo;Be Cervix Savvy&rsquo; Roadshow in 2017.</p>
              <p>The campaign will launch on 18 June 2018 and run for five weeks, visiting Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow. There will also be further locations in Fife and Lanarkshire too.</p>
              <p>Jo&rsquo;s is now <a href="https://www.jostrust.org.uk/support/volunteer-for-jo-s/volunteering-for-jo-s/volunteer-our-roadshow-0">looking for volunteers </a>to join the roadshow and talk to people who come on to the unit who may have questions, have concerns or just want some information.</p>

              <p>Scottish Government funding is assisting the Malawian College of Medicine make vital improvements through collaboration with the University of Glasgow.</p>
              <p>The College of Medicine identified two priority areas which would benefit from Scottish support, on governance and their dental school.</p>
              <p>The College of Medicine will shortly become a fully independent university. The University of Glasgow, which already has successful partnerships in place with the College, has agreed to establish a formal mentoring and support link to assist them with this new phase in their development. To help fund this, the Scottish Government will invest &pound;100,000 over the next two years.</p>
              <p>Their dental school requires a pre-clinical skills facility known as a &lsquo;phantom head&rsquo; unit. This allows students to learn operative techniques before they begin to treat patients. The Scottish Government is providing &pound;50,000 to fully refurbish the phantom heads unit at the College&rsquo;s Lilongwe Dental Skills facility.</p>
              <p>These announcements have been made as President Peter Mutharika of Malawi visits Scotland to strengthen the long-standing relationship between the two countries.</p>
              <p>During his time in Scotland the President will also undertake a visit to the Scottish Water facility at Glencorse in Midlothian.</p>
              <p>Scottish Water are working with colleagues in Malawi to share technology and water management excellence, already providing access to clean and safe water to over 33,000 people, as well as training over 4,000 people on new irrigation techniques and improving agricultural practices.</p>
              <p>The President of Malawi is visiting Scotland between Monday 23<sup>rd</sup> and Thursday 26<sup>th</sup> April 2018.</p>
              <p>Speaking ahead of the President&rsquo;s visit, International Development Minister Alasdair Allan said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland and Malawi have long-standing bonds of friendship and shared history. From the work of David Livingstone to the development partnerships we see today, our countries have a long record of working together to improve global health.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This latest collaborative work between the Malawian College of Medicine and the University of Glasgow, supported by the Scottish Government, will further improve health outcomes for the people of Malawi.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m especially pleased that we are able to make this commitment while welcoming President Mutharika to Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Glasgow, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The University is delighted to have the opportunity of working in collaboration with the current University of Malawi College of Medicine as it moves to become a fully independent university in its own right.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have developed a number of partnerships and links with the College of Medicine in recent years, including a joint healthcare project supporting clinical research into inflammatory and cardiac diseases in the communities of Malawi and Scotland, which has also received Scottish Government funding.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;A number of the University&rsquo;s leading researchers and clinicians already work very closely with colleagues in Malawi and as an institution we look forward to deepening further our long-standing relationship with Malawi.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>A new amendment has been tabled to the Social Security (Scotland) Bill, which would remove any time qualification for people who are terminally ill.</p>
              <p>Current UK legislation for disability benefits and Universal Credit specifies that the definition of terminal illness is someone likely to die within 6 months. Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman has put forward an amendment to ensure that it will be entirely down to the clinical judgement of medical professionals to identify when a person is terminally ill and this will ensure they can be automatically fast-tracked to the highest rate of disability benefits when they are devolved to the Scottish Parliament</p>
              <p>Ms Freeman said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Working through the best approach to terminal illness for our new social security system in Scotland has been the most challenging aspect of this legislation. It is both sensitive and difficult because a diagnosis of terminal illness brings with it a significant impact on the individual and their family and implications for the care and management of their condition.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Medical practitioners who make these decisions are aware of these facts and I am very conscious of the vital role that they will play in implementing this important change. And I am grateful to the medical professionals for providing their views.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am also grateful to everyone else involved for their very considered approach to this complex issue, and for continuing to discuss this with me. We are all determined to get this right for both the people of Scotland and our medical professionals. And, I believe that we have arrived at the right solution to ensure that people who are already in extremely difficult circumstances are able to access the maximum level of&nbsp; financial support they are entitled to &ndash; quickly, with dignity, and with no assessment process involved. I hope this amendment receives cross-party support at Stage 3 on Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;">Today&rsquo;s report is significant as it marks the conclusion of a three-year reporting period and allows for a detailed comparison with the established 2011-13 baseline period. Although data has previously been published on a quarterly basis, this milestone allows for more in-depth comparison and analysis, and therefore more confidence in the data.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Compared to 2011-13, since the cameras were introduced, the following pattern has emerged:</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dunblane to Inverness</strong></p>
              <ul style="text-align: justify;">
              <li>10 fewer people killed</li>
              <li>16 fewer people seriously injured</li>
              <li>96 fewer people injured</li>
              <li>Average number of fatal casualties down by over 40%</li>
              <li>Average number of &lsquo;fatal and serious&rsquo; casualties down by 31%</li>
              <li>Average number of fatal collisions down by over 23%</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Perth to Inverness</strong></p>
              <ul style="text-align: justify;">
              <li>9 fewer people killed</li>
              <li>14 fewer people seriously injured</li>
              <li>81 fewer people injured</li>
              <li>Average number of fatal casualties down by over 40%</li>
              <li>Average number of &lsquo;fatal and serious&rsquo; casualties down by over 32%</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Dunblane to Perth</strong></p>
              <ul style="text-align: justify;">
              <li>&nbsp;2 fewer people seriously injured</li>
              <li>15 fewer people injured</li>
              <li>Average number of fatal casualties down by 50%</li>

              <li>Average number of fatal collisions down by 50%</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Welcoming the report, Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said:</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Behind every statistic lies a tragic story and one of devastation for the families of those involved. We should never lose sight of that and we will never be complacent when it comes to road safety. My thoughts are first and foremost with those who have lost loved ones or been seriously injured in road accidents.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;However I also have to pay tribute to the work of the A9 Safety Group and recognise that the speed cameras &ndash; which were initially heavily criticised in some quarters &ndash; have undoubtedly made the A9 safer.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Alongside successful education and marketing campaigns driver behaviour has improved - ten lives saved and&nbsp;16 fewer people seriously injured is testament to that. The work of the Group will of course continue and with work on the A9 dualling programme progressing I am confident the route will continue to be a safer place.&rdquo;</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A9 Safety Group Chair Stuart Wilson said:</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Now that we are in possession of three years of comprehensive data we can paint a more detailed picture of the improvements we&rsquo;ve seen as a direct result of the speed cameras, various campaigns, and HGV pilot.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;In addition to the most important point that fatalities and serious injuries have dropped by a significant margin, figures on speeding, journey time, incidents and traffic volumes continue to show a long-term sustained change in driver behavior, which is extremely encouraging.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;The number of vehicles exceeding the speed limit has a consistent level of 1 in 15 now compared to the historic figure of 1 in 3. The latest data also confirms a reduction in incident frequency and impact along the route which has had a clear impact on journey time reliability &ndash; a vital issue for the economy, tourism and haulage sector. Restriction time was 25 per cent lower in 2017 compared to the baseline period.</p>

              <p>In a move sure to be welcomed by passengers, the West Highland Lines Review Group will look at opportunities to improve performance and journey times on the route from Helensburgh Upper to Fort William, Mallaig and Oban.</p>
              <p>It will also use a partnership approach to identify rail related initiatives for passengers and freight that exploit and enhance the economic and social value of the line and the communities it serves.</p>
              <p>Mr Yousaf said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The West Highland Line is one of our most scenic rail route and provides a vital service to the communities and businesses that lie along its route.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Building upon the success of other groups, such as the Far North Line Review Team, we are determined to make the most of this important asset for all users, particularly our tourism industry.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Key to the group&rsquo;s success will be our commitment to building on work carried out so far and strengthening the partnerships that will help drive forward a 21<sup>st</sup> railway.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The group builds on work carried out so far and will be led by Transport Scotland&rsquo;s Director of Rail; members will include Network Rail, ScotRail, Tactrans; HITRANS, and SPT, as well as representatives from the freight industry, local councils, community groups and other operators on this route.</p>
              <p>Its purpose will be to identify timetable improvements, consider infrastructure options and subsequently promote appropriate projects for future investment for passengers and freight.</p>
              <p>Speaking on behalf of all the relevant Regional Transport Partnerships, HITRANS Chair Allan Henderson said:</p>
              <p>"The Regional Transport Partnerships fortunate enough to have the world-famous West Highland Lines running through them are pleased to be part of the West Highland Lines Review Group which will help to provide a platform for the development of the routes to Oban, Fort William and Mallaig, maximising their value for local residents including islanders, tourists and freight in the various communities served by the WHL in the SPT, Tactran and HITRANS areas."</p>
              <p>Hege Hernaes, Secretary of West Highland Community Rail Partnership said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have been pressing for a comprehensive Line Review for some time, and are delighted the Minister for Transport has been receptive to our reasoning. The communities along the West Highland Line are keen to see it realise its full potential. More frequent services and an improved travel experience will make it easy for tourists and the local communities to opt for the train.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Encouraging rail travel, as part of a truly coordinated transport system, is the only sustainable way forward and offers huge opportunities and benefits for our local economy. We are hopeful that local user groups and representatives from the wider community will now have an opportunity to engage with the transport sector in constructive discussions that will deliver a better railway future for the West Highlands.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>As well as consideration of capacity, resilience and services, including those linked to the promotion of tourism and active travel, the Group will review the branding, marketing and promotion of the line in collaboration with communities and businesses, drawing on best practice from other routes.</p>
              <p>The Review Group also has a remit to address the present, the mid-term and provide strategic proposals for the future.</p>

              <p>Wildlife crime investigations could be supported by new research into retrieving human DNA found at the scene, even days after the incident has taken place.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The research was initiated by the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime (PAW) Scotland and carried out by the Scottish Police Authority&rsquo;s (SPA) Forensic Services, the Scottish Government and the University of Strathclyde.</p>
              <p>It found DNA can be traced on traps that have been outside for at least 10 days, and from rabbit baits and bird carcasses at crime scenes after at least 24 hours.</p>
              <p>Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham, who is also chair of PAW Scotland, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Poisoning, trapping and shooting are all methods used to illegally target birds of prey, however investigations can often be hampered by a lack of evidence.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This new research will unlock the potential of using DNA profiles to track criminals and could play a crucial role in helping secure convictions for wildlife crime.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We continue to prioritise wildlife crime and are working to develop new ways to protect our precious birds of prey, including through a new wildlife crime detective post at Police Scotland HQ and a new team of special constables to tackle rural crime in the Cairngorms National Park.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Steven Ferguson, Lead Forensic Scientist at SPA Forensic Services, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This exciting research in support of tackling wildlife crime demonstrates that DNA profiles can be obtained from items exposed to the elements in Scotland's sometimes harsh climate.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In recent years, over &pound;6 million has been invested in new forensic capability in Scotland including DNA24, robotics and powerful software to successfully obtain DNA profiles in support of the Scottish justice system.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The research undertaken by PAW has demonstrated that these same techniques, used in crimes ranging from housebreaking to murder, can also be used to identify those involved in persecuting birds of prey.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Detective Chief Superintendent David McLaren said:</p>
              <p>"The illegal use of traps are often used in remote places. This makes the collection of evidence extremely challenging.&nbsp; Police Scotland always welcomes advancement in scientific techniques to solve wildlife crime and has always used all the available tools in our pursuit of those who commit wildlife crime.</p>
              <p>"This new technique will advance our ability to collect Human DNA from illegally set traps."</p>

              <p>The country&rsquo;s most senior clinician is encouraging patients to get more involved in their treatment and care options.</p>
              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr Catherine Calderwood is calling for a move away from the &ldquo;doctor knows best&rdquo; culture in her annual Practising Realistic Medicine report, which sets out steps to help patients get more involved in their medical consultations.</p>
              <p>Currently four health boards across the country are highlighting five key questions to help patients to get the most out of conversations with their doctor or nurse, with the CMO calling on others to now follow suit.</p>
              <p>The report also provides an update on the CMO&rsquo;s National Atlas of Variation for Health and Health Care. The online publication will go live in June this year and will help patients inform themselves before they discuss treatment options with their doctor.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the launch of her report at Airdrie Community Health Practice, Dr Calderwood said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want to ensure patients receive care and treatment that&rsquo;s right for them. I want to see a change in culture to one where both professionals and people receiving care combine their expertise and become more comfortable in sharing decision making.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the five questions feature in my report - because they offer a simple and straightforward way to have better conversations between doctors patients and their families.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;One of the ways in which we can bring realistic medicine into practice is by addressing the harm and waste caused by over-provision and over-treatment. By freeing up resources which are currently being used to no clinical benefit, we will be able to re-invest in healthcare that provides better value to patients.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we will shortly publish the beginnings of a publically-accessible National Atlas of Variation for Health and Healthcare.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There have been times when I&rsquo;ve realised that I have privileged access to information about my care simply because of my own medical training. I hope that patients will be able to use Atlas data to discuss their options with their doctors and avoid the potential harm caused by unnecessary tests, treatments and procedures.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I very much hope that the Atlas will help to inspire health and care professionals to discuss why variation in healthcare exists and ensure that everyone in Scotland receives care that is right for them.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The five questions being piloted by patients across NHS Borders, Forth Valley and Dumfries and Galloway and Lanarkshire are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Is this test, treatment or procedure really needed?</li>

              <p>Improving bus services to Edinburgh, Newcastle and Carlisle and to hospitals serving the Borders area, along with enhanced park and ride facilities and an active travel network across the Borders council area are among 21 options recommended for further appraisal work in the <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/our-approach/strategy/strategic-transport-projects-review/#50679"><strong>Borders Transport Corridors study draft report.</strong></a> &nbsp; Other options that have emerged and are worthy of further consideration include dualling&nbsp; the remaining sections of the A1 between Dunbar&nbsp; and the border, improvements to the A7 and A68 and proposals for extending the Borders railway. &nbsp; The recommendations from the study, published in draft today for a six week consultation with stakeholders and the public, will be considered as part of the forthcoming Scotland-wide review of the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR2).</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said:</p>
              <p>"In our Programme for Government a commitment was given to consider the future transport needs of the Scottish Borders including examining the case for extending the Borders railway along with potential improvements to the A1, A7 and A68. This was on top of the commitments already made, such as East Linton and Reston Stations, as part of a programme of works aimed at improving capacity to the east of Edinburgh.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This report is an important milestone in delivering that commitment. The Borders Transport Corridors study considered a number of issues including accessibility in the Borders and links between its communities and the key markets of Edinburgh, Carlisle and Newcastle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The draft study has identified a range of options, including improved bus services, active travel, road and rail infrastructure in the region, which will be taken forward for more detailed appraisal in the second Strategic Transport Projects Review. This national review will ensure that we deliver transport improvements for all of Scotland which are fit for the 21st Century.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The study has been developed in partnership with Scottish Borders Council and SEStran and I was delighted to see the level of public interest. We will be continuing to engage and there is now an opportunity for all to comment on these 21 options and I would encourage anyone with an interest to have their say.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;The consultation period for comments on the draft study ends on Friday 1 June.</p>

              <p>Glasgow International (GI) will be able to apply for Scottish Government&rsquo;s Festivals Expo funding for the first time in 2019-20.</p>
              <p>GI will be eligible to apply for funding to support the 2020 edition of the festival, profiling artists from across Scotland to an international audience and industry professionals.<br />&nbsp;<br />Speaking ahead&nbsp;of the&nbsp;GI launch at Glasgow City Chambers, Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Since its launch in 2005, Glasgow International has grown from strength to strength, presenting Scotland&rsquo;s largest visual art festival programme and boosting Scotland&rsquo;s culture, tourism and economy.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Festival is recognised internationally for its artistic quality, inclusivity and talent, attracting audiences and investors from across the world. That is why I am pleased to extend the Expo Fund to include GI.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;After opening Expo to Celtic Connections, this is another recognition of the international reach of festivals in Glasgow, enhancing Scotland&rsquo;s global reputation for excellence in culture and creativity.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Richard Parry, Director, Glasgow International, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In only a little over a decade GI has firmly established itself as one of the key dates in the global visual arts calendar. This year we have upwards of 270 artists taking part from over 30 countries, but with the majority living in the city itself, demonstrating the strength of the scene. This vital funding will allow significantly more scope for us to work with and support artists based here to make and show new, powerful and ambitious work.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Julia Amour, Director, Festivals Edinburgh, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The ambitious global reach of GI makes them a great fit for the Festivals Expo Fund, and we look forward to working with both GI and Celtic Connections to further open up international opportunities for cultural talent across Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Amanda Catto, Head of Visual Arts, Creative Scotland, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;GI is a dynamic, biennial showcase that amplifies the richness, reach and character of the city&rsquo;s visual arts community and that promotes some of the very best art being made today. This welcome support from the Scottish Government Expo Fund will enhance GI&rsquo;s role as a major international platform, creating significant opportunities for artists living and working in the city to reach new audiences from across the world.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Councillor David McDonald, Chair of Glasgow Life and Deputy Leader of Glasgow City Council, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Glasgow goes from strength to strength as a leading centre for the production and presentation of contemporary visual arts, supporting a thriving and confident arts community. GI plays a key role in this success, providing invaluable opportunities for artists who live and work in the city and venues throughout Glasgow to reach ever wider audiences, and challenge, question and inspire with their&nbsp; work. With this new support, we can continue to build on these fantastic achievements.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>For the 8th year running, Scotland&rsquo;s population has continued to increase and stands at a record high of 5.42 million, according to statistics published today by the National Records of Scotland (NRS).</p>
              <p>The figures relate to Scotland&rsquo;s population as at 30 June 2017 and show the population continuing to age, with just under one in five people (19%) aged 65 and over, compared to 16% in 2007.</p>
              <p><strong>Why has Scotland&rsquo;s population increased?</strong></p>
              <p>Positive net migration is the reason Scotland&rsquo;s population increased, with 23,900 more people coming to Scotland than leaving (from both overseas and the rest of the UK) over the year to mid-2017. In contrast, natural change (births minus deaths) has not contributed to Scotland&rsquo;s population growth. Across Scotland, there were 3,800 more deaths than births in the year to mid-2017. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>Although Scotland&rsquo;s population increased by 0.4% over the year, the growth rate has slowed compared to previous years. This is due to a reduction in overall net migration (down from 31,700 people in the year to mid-2016), and an increase in the number of deaths. Nevertheless, Scotland&rsquo;s latest population growth remains in line with the normal ranges we have seen over the past decade, where annual growth varied between 0.3% to 0.7%.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Tim Ellis, the Registrar General for Scotland, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Migration continues to be main driver of Scotland&rsquo;s population growth, but in the year following the EU referendum fewer people arrived from overseas than in the previous year. Overall net migration, from both overseas and the rest of the UK, remained positive with more people coming to Scotland than leaving.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The growth in Scotland&rsquo;s population varies across the country &ndash; around two thirds of Scotland&rsquo;s councils (21 councils) increased in population over the last year, compared to a third (11 councils) which experienced population decline.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>An <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/stats-at-a-glance/infographics-and-visualisations">infographic</a> summarising the key points of the NRS report and an <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/stats-at-a-glance/infographics-and-visualisations">interactive data visualisation</a> comparing mid-year population estimates between Scottish council areas is available on the NRS website.</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The National Records of Scotland (NRS) is responsible for producing statistics on Scotland&rsquo;s population.</p>
              <p>Today&rsquo;s report gives estimated population figures for the whole of Scotland and for Council and NHS Board areas. A range of material is available, including:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The full publication (including Council and NHS Board area breakdowns) and previous years&rsquo; population estimates can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/mid-year-population-estimates">Mid-Year Population Estimates</a> section of the NRS website.</li>
              <li>An infographic supplement and interactive data visualisation have also been prepared to accompany this release. These can be accessed from the <a href="http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/stats-at-a-glance/infographics-and-visualisations">Infographics and Visualisations</a> section of the NRS website.</li>
              <li>An overview of the results from the Mid-year estimates for each council area is available in NRS&rsquo; <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/stats-at-a-glance/council-area-profiles">Council area profiles</a>, along with other NRS statistics.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Information about the methodology and quality, including strengths and weaknesses, of the statistics can be found in the <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/mid-year-population-estimates/">Mid-year Estimates for Scotland Methodology Guide.</a></p>
              <p>It should be noted that the data sources used by NRS to estimate migration at council area level do not allow the country or group of countries that overseas migrants come from to be identified.</p>
              <p>Population estimates for the UK as a whole will be published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in June 2018. Further details can be found on the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/release-calendar/index.html">ONS website</a>.</p>

              <p>A new service led by Victim Support Scotland (VSS) will provide free, practical and emotional support to victims of crime across the country.</p>
              <p>The charity has been awarded &pound;13.8 million over three years, part of which will provide for a new homicide service giving families of murder victims access to a dedicated case worker and continuous support.</p>
              <p>It will also lead development of a new &lsquo;victim centred&rsquo; approach, working with partners to streamline points of contact, improve information flow and ensure victims of crime feel supported through the criminal justice system. This will reduce the need for victims to have to retell their story to several different organisations as they seek help.</p>
              <p>Justice Secretary Michael Matheson announced the funding on a visit to VSS in Edinburgh where he met the charity&rsquo;s chief executive, Kate Wallace, and Bea Jones, founder of The Moira Fund and mother of Moira Jones who was murdered in Queens Park, Glasgow in 2008.</p>
              <p>He said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am aware that victims and their families often have to turn to multiple&nbsp; organisations to get information about the criminal justice process and find out what support they are entitled to receive. This can feel like they are being passed from one organisation to another &ndash; adding to their trauma when they are most vulnerable.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I want to improve the situation and that is why I am announcing funding for VSS to work in partnership with criminal justice and victim support bodies to develop a new approach. Along with the Homicide Service it will ease the journey for victims and their families, whether or not they engage with the criminal justice process.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Kate Wallace, Chief Executive of VSS said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted with the shift to three-year funding which provides us with greater long-term stability to enhance the front-line support we provide for people affected by crime. The creation of the Homicide Service and the victim-centred approach are also very positive new developments and we will be working closely with all our partners to make these a reality.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Bea Jones, who has campaigned for greater support in Scotland for families bereaved through murder said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is an important step and one which will have a positive impact on many lives in Scotland. It will ensure more families will be helped than before, and that those families will get the right support, at the right time and from the right people.

              <p>A right to independent advocacy services is to be extended to more people under Scotland&rsquo;s new social security service.</p>
              <p>Ahead of the final vote on the Social Security (Scotland) Bill, the Scottish Government has put forward an amendment that would see services provided to anyone who, because of a disability, needs additional support to engage fully with the Scottish social security system.</p>
              <p>Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our social security system will be rights-based and will work to ensure people can access the benefits they&rsquo;re entitled to.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;To make that a practical reality, we have already ensured that anyone who uses Social Security Scotland will be able to have a supporter with them every step of the way. But it&rsquo;s also important that we make sure where people have disabilities that may stop them engaging with the system, that they have the right to access advocacy support.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;After working with key third sector organisations, I am pleased to say that I am now improving on our original proposal and will widen the definition to ensure more people have the right to independent advocacy and are able to enjoy the equivalency of access that everyone else has.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is one more example of how Scotland&rsquo;s social security system will embed respect, dignity and fairness at its heart.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Scottish Commission for Learning Disability Chief Executive Chris Creegan said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Independent advocacy has an important role alongside a suite of practical measures including accessible information, inclusive communication, effective signposting and the ability to be accompanied by a supporter. This approach will help to embed a culture of dignity and respect in the new agency from the start.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Inclusion Scotland Director of Policy Bill Scott said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Inclusion Scotland warmly welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s recognition that many disabled people will require advocacy support to access the new Scottish Social Security system.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Citizens Advice Scotland Policy Officer Rob Gowans said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We welcome this amendment which makes an important contribution to ensuring that disabled people receive what they are entitled to in the new Social Security system. The holistic approach of the CAB network already provides a voice for disabled people, and this amendment will ensure that they are empowered to access the new system and challenge it where necessary.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Camphill Scotland Director Neil Henery said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Camphill Scotland want to ensure that people with learning disability and other support needs get the support they need to participate fully in Scottish society. We were therefore very pleased to work with the Government and other third sector organisations to introduce a right to advocacy for people with learning disability and other support needs to help them gain the support they require.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Around 100 pupils and 20 teachers from 16 Moray primary schools and 4 secondary schools attended an event on Tuesday 17 April in Moray College UHI to celebrate the success of Transport Scotland&rsquo;s schools engagement programme on the A96 Dualling Hardmuir to Fochabers scheme.</p>
              <p>The event let local school children present their projects to a judging panel from Transport Scotland&rsquo;s design consultancy Mott MacDonald Sweco (MMS). Prizes were awarded to the winning teams in different categories.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the first year of the programme, training has been delivered by specialist educational supplier Primary Engineer to 56 primary and 20 secondary school teachers. Engineers from MMS have assisted with presentations, Q&amp;A sessions and class projects.<br />&nbsp; <br />Keith Brown Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work said:<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;As well as upgrading the A96 between Inverness and Aberdeen to dual carriageway, this Government recognises the importance of benefitting the communities who live along the route as we design and build the new road.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;It is fitting in the Year of Young People that our schools engagement is leaving a legacy for the future, training teachers to deliver a programme for pupils in local schools which helps them develop an interest in engineering.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The fact that engineers from Transport Scotland and the consultants designing the dualled route between Hardmuir and Fochabers are taking the time to offer their expertise will help inspire the children to consider being the engineers of the future.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Lise McCaffery, Regional Director for Primary Engineer, expressed her delight with the project outcomes.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful to see how young people and their teachers in Moray have engaged with our engineering programmes, linking with industry professionals and using their creative problem solving. We look forward to seeing how the project grows.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>A package of support for farmers and crofters to help address the impact of recent extreme and adverse weather has been announced by Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing.</p>
              <p>This includes a new &pound;250,000 fund to help farmers offset the cost of retrieving fallen livestock.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government-appointed expert weather panel recognised that recent severe weather had caused a rise in the number of sheep and cattle deaths on farms across Scotland, and that financial support should be provided to those incurring additional costs of disposal of dead cattle and sheep.</p>
              <p>The package also includes action to address feed and fodder shortages and to provide more practical and emotional support to farmers and their families whose wellbeing might be suffering as the long days and nights in harsh conditions take their toll.</p>
              <p>Mr Ewing said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen first-hand the massive impact that the prolonged wet and severe weather has been having on farmers, resulting in higher numbers of dead animals, and acute shortages in fodder across the country.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are already doing a lot to help farmers cope with the adverse conditions.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This includes aiding cash flow through the LFASS and BPS loan schemes, providing specialist advice through our Farm Advisory Service, and actively seeking derogation from the European Commission from the Three Crop rule. However, there is more that can, and must be done.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As a result, I am announcing a further package of support to help farmers and crofters cope. This includes &pound;250,000 to help offset part of the additional costs farmers have faced in the uplift and disposal of dead sheep and cattle.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We know that there are real pressures on feed and fodder currently and that winter and Spring crop sowing has been compromised, so there are likely to be further problems later this autumn. We need to identify longer term solutions to address these so I plan to convene a meeting of commercial feed companies and cooperatives to explore what more can be done to reduce shortages, increase resilience and create collaborative solutions..</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Finally, I recognise the harsh weather and long working hours can take an awful toll on people&rsquo;s wellbeing. I am therefore providing RSABI with additional funding to help them provide more vital practical and emotional support to farmers and their families.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The fallen stock scheme will be operated through the National Fallen Stock Company (NFSCO) in a similar way to the 2013 scheme.</p>

              <p>New investment has been secured for fabrication firm BiFab and its yards at Methil and Burntisland in Fife and Arnish in the Western Isles, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced.</p>
              <p>Canadian company JV Driver, through its subsidiary DF Barnes, has acquired BiFab as part of an agreement brokered by the Scottish Government to support new opportunities at these yards for fabrication and construction in the marine, renewables&nbsp;and energy sector.</p>
              <p>JV Driver is one of Canada&rsquo;s largest independently owned industrial construction companies. It&rsquo;s subsidiary, DF Barnes has been a consistent employer in the oil and gas, fabrication and marine industries for over 80 years.</p>
              <p>DF Barnes and JV Driver&nbsp;will bring project expertise and financial security to the company as it bids for new contracts.&nbsp;BiFab will in turn bring global reach and expansion to&nbsp;DF Barnes&nbsp;to the benefit of both organisations in Scotland and in Canada.&nbsp; As part of the agreement,&nbsp;the Scottish Government will take a minority shareholding in the new company to demonstrate continued commitment to supporting the future of the yard.</p>
              <p>The First Minister and Economy Secretary, Keith Brown who oversaw the negotiations for the Scottish Government met with JV Driver and DF Barnes executive leaders at the BiFab yard at Methil before meeting the GMB union and shop stewards to discuss the agreement.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Economy Secretary will make a statement to the Scottish Parliament later today.</p>
              <p>Speaking at Methil the First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are delivering on the commitment I made last year that we would stand by BiFab and work to secure a long term future for the company.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have been in negotiations with DF Barnes&nbsp;for a number of months and today is a significant step forward in our efforts to restore BiFab to its place at the centre of Scotland&rsquo;s marine energy industry.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;DF Barnes&nbsp;acquisition is a key milestone for all three BiFab yards and as a sign of our commitment to the company&rsquo;s future, the Scottish Government will maintain a close interest by taking a minority shareholding in the company.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There is a lot of hard work ahead, and there is no magic bullet for these yards but the commitment of&nbsp;DF Barnes&nbsp;to securing a new future for the business at Burntisland, Methil and Arnish is a hugely positive step and I believe that gives BiFab the best chance of winning future contracts and securing new work.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This announcement is also a tribute to the efforts of the trade unions and employees at BiFab whose dignified actions throughout this difficult time have played a huge part in enabling us to bring in new investors and creating new employment opportunities in Fife, the Western Isles and for the Scottish economy as a whole.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>DF Barnes CEO Jason Fudge said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;DF Barnes is excited to now have a major presence in Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland has been an admired world leader in the offshore oil and gas and renewable energy sectors and we are delighted to join with the employees of BiFab and the people of Scotland to ensure the continued growth of BiFab for the benefit of all. This is a great day for us.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>DF Barnes VP in Business Development Sean Power said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are looking forward to a long and successful partnership with BiFab.&nbsp; We will work closely with management and the union representatives to ensure continuity for the people who work for the company.&nbsp; We are sensitive to the commitment that employees have made to BiFab and will work hard to meet their expectations.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Economy Secretary Keith Brown said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This agreement gives the workforce, the company and the government the best possible chance of securing a vibrant future for these yards.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government believes BiFab can be a thriving business, supporting Scotland&rsquo;s offshore renewables and oil and gas industry as well as competing internationally.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As the current contract comes to an end, and while efforts go into winning new work there will continue to be difficult times for the yard and there can be no guarantees that contracts will be won but I am confident this agreement, which sees the Scottish Government become a minority shareholder in the company, will deliver for BiFab&rsquo;s future in Fife and the Western Isles.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe Michael Russell has today reiterated that Scottish Ministers are satisfied that the Continuity Bill is within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
              <p>Mr Russell said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Continuity Bill was passed by 95 votes to 32 in the Scottish Parliament, that is an overwhelming majority. Scottish Ministers are satisfied that the Bill is within legislative competence.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Lord Advocate will be arguing in the Supreme Court that it is within the powers of the Scottish Parliament to prepare for the consequences for devolved matters of UK withdrawal from the European Union.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our Continuity Bill is an important and necessary piece of legislation to prepare Scotland&rsquo;s laws for Brexit while protecting the powers of the Scottish Parliament that people voted for.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government has made clear it cannot recommend the Scottish Parliament consent to the Withdrawal Bill in its current form.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Alongside the Welsh Government, we have always said our preference would be to reach an agreement with the UK Government to amend the EU Withdrawal Bill to respect the powers of the devolved administrations and both Governments are ready to &nbsp;continue meaningful talks to further discuss potential solutions.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;While the Scottish Government is not opposed to UK-wide frameworks in certain areas when these are in Scotland&rsquo;s interests, this must only happen with the agreement of the Scottish Parliament.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>A ground-breaking initiative to combat domestic abuse is to be expanded around the country to help maximise victims&rsquo; safety and hold offenders to account for their violence.</p>
              <p>&pound;2.8 million will be available for local authorities to apply for support to roll out the Caledonian System within their area to enable more perpetrators to address their behaviour</p>
              <p>The Caledonian System is a specialist court-mandated programme working with male perpetrators, which also aims to improve the lives of women and children affected.</p>
              <p>The announcement was made by Justice Secretary Michael Matheson while attending training for social workers who work with male offenders and liaise with the women and children&rsquo;s services for the programme. He said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Levels of domestic abuse remain at unacceptably high levels in Scotland. We know that the official statistics still do not paint the whole picture, as victims are often too afraid to report abuse. We also know domestic abuse disproportionately affects women, with men as the primary perpetrators.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Put simply, attitudes need to change. The Caledonian System has been running in parts of Scotland and the evidence indicates that men who completed the programme posed a lower risk to partners, children and others by the end of the programme. Women also reported that they felt safer.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The funding I am announcing today will further strengthen our push to eradicate this scourge on society. Domestic abuse offenders need to understand the harm they cause and what they can do to change their behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Linda Rodgers, Chief Executive of Edinburgh Women's Aid said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is crucial that we have a range of services across Scotland for those affected by domestic abuse and that these services include interventions to support perpetrators to change their behaviour. The Caledonian Programme is a safe and robust perpetrator programme developed in Scotland for the Scottish context.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am absolutely delighted that the programme will now be operating and enhancing the safety of women and children across Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The Caledonian System is not an alternative to prosecution but is a direct alternative to custody and to other high tariff community disposals given after an accused has been convicted of a domestic abuse related offence. If at any point the programme is breached by the perpetrator the case is returned to court for consideration of whether a separate sentence should be imposed. It is currently delivered through hubs in Aberdeen City, City of Edinburgh, Falkirk, Dumfries &amp; Galloway and North Ayrshire Councils.</p>
              <p>The overall funding to the local authorities that deliver the Men&rsquo;s Programme currently is approximately &pound;1.3 million per annum, with approximately &pound;1.1 million distributed to local authorities and SACRO to deliver Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Services.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/11/4240/2">An evaluation of the Caledonian System</a> was published in November 2016. Based on the most recent figures, more than 450 men are engaged with the Men&rsquo;s Programme, with over 1200 having participated since 2011. There have been 1230 women offered access to the Women&rsquo;s Service in that same timescale, with over 720 currently engaging, and 1040 children known to the Children&rsquo;s Service.</p>
              <p>The safety of partners and their children is an absolute priority for the Caledonian System.&nbsp; There was a strong belief among women interviewed for the evaluation that the Women's Service, and the fact that it works together with the Men's Programme as a system, had both contributed significantly to making them safer.</p>
              <p>Evidence indicates that men who completed the programme posed a lower risk to partners, children and others by the end of the programme. There is also evidence that women engaged with the programme feel safer. More information on the Caledonian System is available on <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/violence-against-women-and-girls/strengthening-the-law/">the Scottish Government website</a>.</p>

              <p>More than 95% of Scotland&rsquo;s homes and businesses are now able to connect to fibre broadband.</p>
              <p>The rollout has been delivered through the Digital Scotland Superfast Broadband (DSSB) project, with a total contribution of &pound;280 million from across the public sector in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Without the DSSB programme, it is estimated that only 66% of Scotland would be able to receive fibre broadband.</p>
              <p>Connectivity Secretary Fergus Ewing said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Fast and reliable internet is fundamental for the future economic and social success of communities right across Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is a landmark for the Digital Scotland Superfast Broadband programme, which has connected around 890,000 premises to fibre broadband, and is ensuring Scotland can offer world-class digital infrastructure.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;However, we want to go further, and we are now focusing on delivering our &pound;600 million &lsquo;Reaching 100%&rsquo; programme, which is the biggest public investment ever made in a single UK broadband project. This will make sure every single premise in Scotland can access a speeds of at least 30Mbps by the end of 2021.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>95% coverage was achieved at the end of 2017, in line with the commitment made in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Programme for Government 2017 and has been subject to checking and confirmation processes until this point.</p>
              <p>DSSB is delivered through two projects &ndash; led by Highlands and Islands Enterprise in its area, and the Scottish Government in the rest of Scotland.</p>
              <p>Funding partners also include the UK Government through Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK), BT Group, local authorities and the EU via the European Regional Development Fund.</p>

              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced &pound;2,262,000 to support trade unions in accessing skills and lifelong learning opportunities for workers across Scotland.</p>
              <p>With dedicated funding from the Scottish Government, Scottish Union Learning helps unions to develop and embed learning in the workplace, equipping workers with the skills to progress in the labour market.</p>
              <p>By making training opportunities available at times that suits workers&rsquo; needs, they can upgrade their skills while businesses can develop their workforce and address skills gaps.</p>
              <p>Making the announcement during a speech to the STUC Annual Congress in Aviemore, the First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Trade unions make a huge contribution to workplace learning and training. Scottish Government funding of the Scottish Union Learning programme provides around three thousand people each year with new skills and new opportunities.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;By doing so it enhances the learning and the life chances of workers across the country, and it also brings benefits to the organisations they work for.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It works so well because unions are so good at identifying workers&rsquo; needs, and so passionate about improving workers&rsquo; prospects.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m therefore delighted to be able to confirm that the Scottish Government will continue to support&nbsp; Scottish Union Learning with more than &pound;2 million of investment this year.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>STUC General Secretary Grahame Smith said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We welcome the Scottish Government&rsquo;s continued&nbsp; support&nbsp; for Scottish Union Learning.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This will allow us to work alongside unions to develop the knowledge, skills and confidence of around 9,000 workers in Scotland.&nbsp; It will also ensure that we can continue to enhance the diversity of union leadership.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We appreciate the confidence the Scottish Government has shown in the work we do to give workers the opportunity they would not otherwise have to develop personally and professionally.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>A new publication sets out how digitisation, automation and other innovations will affect the Scottish labour market.</p>
              <p>The joint report from the Scottish Government and the Scottish Trades Union Congress follows from the First Minister&rsquo;s recent biannual meetings with the STUC, where discussions addressed the growing anxiety among some workers that their jobs may either be lost or changed due to new technologies.</p>
              <p>It discusses competing claims about the future of work and assesses the extent that technology is already affecting the labour market, and identifies areas for further consideration.</p>
              <p>Speaking before she addressed STUC Congress First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This report highlights the continuing positive and constructive relationship the Scottish Government enjoys with trade unions - in stark contrast to the confrontational approach of the UK Government.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We share a common objective with the STUC - to ensure automation and digitisation have positive outcomes for all of Scotland&rsquo;s people.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scottish workers are already benefitting from quality job opportunities in sectors such as game development and data analytics where we are at the forefront of technological change.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The report recognises and addresses the genuine fears many workers have over ways in which technology might affect their working lives and future job prospects, and highlights where Scottish Government approaches to skills development and fair work can help meet the challenges of technological change.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Grahame Smith, STUC General Secretary said:&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Automation represents a major challenge to how work is organised, but it is still unclear how it will affect the quality and type of work in the long term. Predictions swing between utopian visions of emancipation through technology, to dystopian views of severe inequality.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The STUC and Scottish Government report cuts through this debate to recognise both the positive and negative impacts of automation. It found examples where new technologies lead to job losses, such as the closure of bank branches due to increased internet banking; and examples where it can improve safety and security, like the digitised records in the health service.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In all cases, workers must be involved in how automation is introduced, shaping or controlling their own workplaces through collective trade union involvement. Otherwise we are likely to see automation pursued as a cost-cutting, profit-driven measure, implemented without proper training or controls, or used to abuse staff with inappropriate targets or high levels of surveillance. These are the sorts of consequences we will be debating at Congress, which the union movement is working to avoid.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Research to develop new treatments for Motor Neurone Disease (MND) has been announced by the Scottish Government and the UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
              <p>Almost &pound;400,000 will be invested over the next three years to fund two postdoctoral posts at the University.</p>
              <p>The scientists will work in partnership with the Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, a Scotland wide research network.</p>
              <p>Their work will look at chemical compounds that have the potential to be developed into drugs to treat MND. These would then go through a process that could include clinical trials to test their safety and effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want to ensure that people living with neurological conditions such as Motor Neurone Disease, which is diagnosed in around 200 Scots annually, have access to the best possible care and support across the country.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This partnership between the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Chief Scientist Office and the University of Edinburgh will allow us to build on our previous MND research funding, which includes a number of Ph.D Studentships totalling almost half a million pounds over five years.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This continues the work we&rsquo;ve done with a number of stakeholders in recent years. For example, not only did MND Scotland support us in the creation of these studentships, but we&rsquo;ve worked with them to double the number of MND specialist nurses.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re also working with The Neurological Alliance of Scotland, NHS boards, integration joint boards and those who live with neurological conditions on Scotland&rsquo;s first National Action Plan on Neurological Conditions.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;City of Edinburgh Professor of Pharmacology and Associate Director, UK DRI at the University of Edinburgh, Giles Hardingham said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Investment in MND care, clinical research and training represent a huge and growing shift in momentum over recent years. We are delighted to be partnering the Chief Scientist Office in this venture to identify and develop new treatments for MND clinical trials and experimental medicine in Scotland, and we are honoured to have the chance to add to this momentum.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Projects to mark the suffrage movement will receive &pound;500,000 from the Centenary Fund.</p>
              <p>The Fund will support a variety of projects including those looking to improve women&rsquo;s political representation and participation in public life.</p>
              <p>As part of the Centenary Fund, up to &pound;170,000 will be made available for local and community based projects to apply to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Vote Centenary Small Grant Scheme.</p>
              <p>Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have come a long way since some women secured the right to vote 100 hundred years ago, yet much still needs to be done to eradicate gender inequality and create a fairer, safer and more equal society.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Vote Centenary Small Grant Scheme is now open for applications.&nbsp; We are asking local communities to think of creative ways in which they can mark the centenary and I would encourage those that can to apply to the scheme as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This funding will ensure we pay tribute to the women who fought so hard for the rights that women have today, as well as playing an important part in encouraging the next generation of women leaders.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The funding allocations are:</p>

              <p>New measures to combat organised crime in force from tomorrow (Monday) will widen what can be classed as cash when seizing assets.</p>
              <p>The provisions from the Criminal Finances Act 2017 now mean that betting slips, casino chips and gaming vouchers can now be seized as if they were currency.</p>
              <p>Police Scotland will also be able to search for and seize items of value such as jewellery, watches, stamps and precious stones where they are suspected of being involved in illegal activity, in the same way they already do with cash.</p>
              <p>Cabinet Secretary for Justice Michael Matheson said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is a significant step in ensuring criminals cannot profit from unlawful activities and gives our law enforcement agencies additional powers to seize assets acquired by illegal means.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;More than &pound;6 million was recovered by the Crown Office and the Civil Recovery Unit in 2017/18. However, expanding the definition of what can be treated as cash and what our police officers can search for as they seek to disrupt criminal activity has the potential to further impact Scottish organised crime.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am determined that crime will not pay and that every ill-gotten asset can be put back into communities through the Cashback programme, whether it&rsquo;s a gemstone, betting slip or casino chip. There must be no respite in tackling organised crime and the harm it causes.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Responding to UK involvement in the US led strikes First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;My thoughts this morning are with service personnel called to action.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We cannot tolerate Syria&rsquo;s use of chemical weapons on a civilian population &ndash; but there has been no explanation from the Prime Minister or the President on how this action, taken without parliament&rsquo;s approval, will halt the use of chemical weapons or contribute to a long term peace in the area.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Air strikes by US and UK forces have not resolved the situation in Syria in the past and I am not persuaded they will do so now.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This action risks not just further escalating the civil war in Syria but also a dangerous escalation of international tensions.&nbsp;There must be urgent confirmation from the Prime Minister that there will be no further action and no change to the role of UK military in regards to Syria without a full parliamentary debate.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;An international strategy is urgently required to bring peace and stability to the region.&nbsp; UK foreign policy should be aimed at reaching an international consensus not simply complying with Presidential wishes.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Restoration to parts of Bute House, the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland, has now been completed. The premises return to full operation as a working government building when it hosts the Scottish Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>The conservation work, coordinated by Historic Environment Scotland, began in October after routine monitoring revealed urgent ceiling repairs were required to the category A listed Georgian building, part of Edinburgh&rsquo;s New Town World Heritage site.</p>
              <p>Extensive work was carried out to stabilise and retain the ornate plaster ceiling in the drawing room &ndash; the main public reception room in the building &ndash; and strengthen the floors above.</p>
              <p>Both traditional techniques and modern materials were used in the repairs, which have preserved for the future the unique features of the building, including the cantilevered stone staircase.</p>
              <p>Maintenance and modernisation work also took place while Bute House was closed. This included repairing faulty ventilation systems, installing heating for the first time throughout the whole building, and refurbishing the toilet facilities.</p>
              <p>The costs of repairs and the associated works were as follows:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Building restoration, enabling works and maintenance &ndash; &pound;504,216</li>
              <li>Alternative accommodation arrangements for the First Minister - &pound;19,220 (inclusive of &pound;11,008 rent)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Welcoming the completion of the work to restore Bute House, Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Designed by Robert Adam, Bute House forms the centrepiece of Charlotte Square and is one of the finest architectural achievements of Georgian Edinburgh.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These necessary repairs and refurbishments mean Bute House can continue to be available for official Scottish Government business, as well as being preserved as an important historical and cultural asset for the nation.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;My thanks go to Historic Environment Scotland and the skilled team of craftsmen and women who were part of what was a complex restoration project.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Karen Williamson,&nbsp;District Architect at Historic Environment Scotland, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Bute House project spanned many elements, including renovations to the fabric of the building as well as intricate works to the ceiling in the drawing room.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In keeping with other buildings of this type and age, the Georgian interiors of Bute House require specialist work and craft skills, as part of its wider conservation, with a number of specialist crafts utilised throughout the period of project.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This also meant that, as part of the wider project team, we could involve apprentices, providing a unique opportunity to work on the official residence of the First Minister.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The newly restored Great Polish Map of Scotland and a 3D model of the monument have been unveiled.</p>
              <p>The 3D model, which has been created by Historic Environment Scotland (HES), highlights the cultural links between Scotland and Poland and will be presented as a Scottish contribution to the Polish independence centenary celebrations in November this year.</p>
              <p>During a visit to the map&rsquo;s site at the Barony Castle Hotel in Eddleston, Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Great Polish Map of Scotland is a fine example of Scotland&rsquo;s ties and friendship with Poland. I congratulate the individuals and volunteers involved in its restoration for their incredible work.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This restored version of the map and its digital model further strengthen the long-standing cultural connections between our nations and highlight our shared history and heritage.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As we prepare to celebrate the centenary of Poland regaining its independence, we hope the 3D model will contribute to raising awareness of the strong bonds between Scotland and Poland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Ireneusz Truszkowski, Consul General of the Republic of Poland in Edinburgh, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are delighted to be able to officially unveil the restored Great Polish Map of Scotland in the same year in which Poland is celebrating its 100th anniversary of regaining independence. The map has a great potential and I hope it will be used also for educational purposes that will benefit current and future generations of Scots and Poles, increasing the understanding of our common history.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Alex Paterson, Chief Executive of HES, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are very pleased to have collaborated with partners to digitally document the Great Polish Map of Scotland, particularly as we celebrate the European Year of Cultural Heritage. The 3D model of this unique site showcases our cutting-edge digital documentation work, and how this technology can be used to bring history to life.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The 3D scanning of the Great Polish Map of Scotland has been undertaken by <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/about-us/news/digital-map-brings-scottish-polish-links-to-life/">HES</a> and it involved creating a detailed recording of the map using laser-scanning, digital photogrammetry and high resolution image capture.</p>
              <p>The interactive application highlighting Scotland&rsquo;s Polish heritage has been developed in collaboration with <a href="http://www.mapascotland.org/">MapaScotland</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/xSokSh">Polish-Scottish Heritage</a>, a project developed by <a href="https://goo.gl/wgXUcM">Polish Cultural Festival Association</a>.

              <p>A new Chinese edition of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie will be published in China to mark the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Muriel Spark&rsquo;s birth.</p>
              <p>The publication will carry a foreword written by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who announced the new publication at an event at Fudan University in Shanghai to celebrate both Muriel Spark&rsquo;s centenary and China&rsquo;s year-long &lsquo;Inspiring Women in the Arts&rsquo; campaign.</p>
              <p>Addressing an audience of students, academics and publishing professionals she spoke of her love of Muriel Spark, and her work to encourage young people to take up reading through the First Minister&rsquo;s Reading Challenge.</p>
              <p>The event was organised by the British Council and attended by Chen ZhiMin, Associate Vice President of Fudan University, Scottish-based authors Claire McFall and Louise Welsh, Chinese author &lrm;Jing Xing, Wang Hong Tu, Director of Shanghai Writers&rsquo; Association and Creative Scotland&rsquo;s Head of Literature, Languages and Publishing Jenny Niven.</p>
              <p>The First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am delighted that Chinese readers will be soon able to enjoy a new edition of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, and as a huge admirer of Muriel Spark&rsquo;s work I am honoured to be given the opportunity to write the foreword.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This publication highlights the global appeal of Muriel Spark, and underlines her status as one of Scotland&rsquo;s best-loved writers. She has inspired countless female authors to take up writing, and I&rsquo;m confident she will continue to do so.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s creative industries are vital for the economy, and publishing plays an important role in that. The global programme of events being held to mark the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Muriel Spark can only help to promote the spread and popularity of Scottish authors.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Nick Marchand, the British Council&rsquo;s Director Arts - China and North East Asia, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In a year of Inspiring Women in the Arts in China, we&rsquo;re delighted to support Scotland&rsquo;s celebrations of the Centenary Year of Muriel Spark. It&rsquo;s thrilling to connect a literary history with contemporary Scottish writers Louise Welsh and Claire McFall - particularly given Claire&rsquo;s cult following in China for <em>Ferryman</em>. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s clear the connections made with Shanghai&rsquo;s Fudan University through a shared love of literature now offer some exciting opportunities for creative collaboration in the future.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Jenny Niven said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is just fantastic that Muriel Spark&rsquo;s centenary is being honoured in China in this way. As a true internationalist herself I&rsquo;d like to think Muriel would be delighted too that her work is being introduced to new audiences around the world.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The First Minister&rsquo;s contribution of the foreword to the new translation of Miss Jean Brodie is a clear testament to the value that she places on reading and on literature &ndash; and will no doubt make the book a collectors&rsquo; edition. Louise Welsh and Claire McFall illustrate the importance of sharing stories between cultures and nations and we&rsquo;re delighted they&rsquo;ve participated in this extraordinary series of events.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>A major new campaign will put Scotland in the international spotlight and showcase the country&rsquo;s world-leading assets to a global audience.</p>
              <p>Launching simultaneously today in North America, London and China, &lsquo;Scotland is Now&rsquo; is designed to put the country firmly at the top of everyone&rsquo;s list of places to live, work, study, invest and visit.</p>
              <p>Attracting more migrant talent, international students, expanding overseas businesses and high-spend tourists will grow Scotland&rsquo;s economy and further cement its reputation as an open, diverse and welcoming country.</p>
              <p>The campaign sees the Scottish Government, VisitScotland, Scottish Development International and Universities Scotland join forces for the first time to promote Scotland under a single unified national brand, bringing together combined spending of up to &pound;6 million to promote Scotland globally.</p>
              <p>&lsquo;Scotland is Now&rsquo; builds on the nation&rsquo;s acknowledged strengths as a land of unrivalled history, breath-taking scenery and warm welcomes, but shines a light on lesser-known qualities: a pioneering, dynamic and progressive nation taking the lead on key global challenges.</p>
              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who unveiled the campaign in China, said:</p>
              <p>"The message at the heart of &lsquo;Scotland is Now&rsquo; is of a bold and positive country offering the warmest of welcomes, rich in history and heritage and with a progressive, pioneering and inclusive approach to our future.</p>
              <p>"The campaign will inspire people to be part of Scotland&rsquo;s future and tell Scotland&rsquo;s story through those who know it best &ndash; people who have embraced living, working, studying, visiting and investing here."</p>
              <p>The campaign includes a core Scotland film, which is being launched today, alongside a number of &lsquo;people&rsquo; films which offer a personal perspective from those who call Scotland home.</p>
              <p>Economy Secretary Keith Brown offered audiences in New York a sneak-peek at &lsquo;Scotland is Now&rsquo; during Scotland Week last week, while the campaign is being launched in China as part of the First Minister&rsquo;s visit. The campaign will be showcased at an event in London on Friday hosted by Culture, Tourism and External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop.</p>
              <p>The campaign brings together public sector partners with key business interests and will be a vehicle to support export growth in the private sector.</p>
              <p>Gerry O&rsquo;Donnell, Corporate Affairs Director at Edrington (the company behind iconic whisky brands such as Macallan), said:</p>
              <p>"&lsquo;Scotland is Now&rsquo; presents a confident narrative that connects well with Scotch whisky&rsquo;s authenticity and growth potential. It&rsquo;s a story that all exporters can get behind."</p>
              <p>Scotland has more world-class universities per head of population than almost anywhere else in the world, has the highest percentage of international and EU students than anywhere else in the UK and is the most successful part of the UK for spin-out creation.</p>
              <p>Professor Sir Jim McDonald, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Strathclyde said:</p>
              <p>"&lsquo;Scotland is Now&rsquo; is a vibrant and modern way to demonstrate all that the country has to offer. Our university sector is one of the very best in the world and each year we generate thousands of work-ready graduates, discover new knowledge, produce new research and create innovative developments which help society to tackle its biggest issues.</p>

              <p>Cabinet Secretary for External Affairs Fiona Hyslop has written to the Home Secretary Amber Rudd to raise concerns about the case of the Merry family from Coatbridge who face being separated as a result of the UK&rsquo;s immigration rules.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government has consistently opposed the UK Government&rsquo;s restrictions to family migration, questioning the changes to UK family migration policy changes and recently published &lsquo;Scotland&rsquo;s Population Needs &amp; Migration Policy&rsquo;.</p>
              <p>Full text of the letter is below.</p>
              <p>I am writing with regards to the Merry family from Coatbridge, whose situation has recently been brought to my attention.</p>
              <p>I have been advised that Mrs Volha Merry has been refused permission to remain in the UK and has been ordered by the Home Office to leave the UK by Wednesday 11 April. I understand&nbsp; Mr Merry is a UK citizen and the couple have a young daughter who is a British citizen, born in Scotland.</p>
              <p>We understand that the family have taken steps to allow them to remain in the UK under the relevant immigration requirements.&nbsp; As we set out in our response to the UKBA&rsquo;s consultation that preceded changes to the family migration route in 2012, the Scottish Government remains deeply concerned that the restrictions on family migration are having a damaging impact on many ordinary, hard-working Scottish citizens, their families and our economy, and we continue to support greater flexibility in these rules. In our recently published paper &lsquo;Scotland&rsquo;s Population Needs &amp; Migration Policy&rsquo;, we call for a different approach to family migration, to improve the rights of people in Scotland and the UK to bring close family into the country with them, respecting the right to family life and the rights of British children.&nbsp; In this case, it involves the right of a particularly young child, born here in the UK, not to be separated from one or other of her parents, one of whom is a UK citizen.&nbsp; We also believe that the UK Government should continue to protect the rights of the family members of EU citizens after Brexit, and should take account of the value of family life by extending these rights to the family members of UK citizens.</p>
              <p>I would be grateful if you could look into this case as a matter of urgency and would welcome information on your conclusions.</p>
              <p>Fiona Hyslop</p>

              <p>Specialist expertise from Scotland is to help grow and sustain social enterprises in China.</p>
              <p>Social enterprise development organisation The Social Enterprise Academy (SEA) has launched a new partnership to serve social enterprises in China, supported by the Scottish Government.</p>
              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon launched the Social Enterprise Academy in China on a visit to a traditional hutong (alleyway) in Beijing's old town.</p>
              <p>Social enterprises reinvest their profits to create positive social change, promotiing economic growth that is inclusive.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Examples in Scotland include the Grassmarket Community Project, Community Energy Scotland and Edinburgh Remakery.</p>
              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:</p>
              <p>"Scotland is a world-leading social enterprise nation in research, policy and practice, so it is great news that the Social Enterprise Academy will now be supporting social enterprises in China.</p>
              <p>"It is further evidence that Scotland is an outwardly facing and enterprising nation, keen to share its knowledge, build new trading links and demonstrate how businesses can provide social and environmental, as well as economic, benefit."</p>
              <p>Sam Baumber, Managing Director of Social Enterprise Academy International CIC, said:</p>
              <p>"People in communities around the world are stepping up to tackle social and environmental issues with sustainable business models. As they face new challenges, these people and their teams need sustained support. We are delighted to be launching SEA China as part of China's emerging support ecosystem for social enterprise and social investment.</p>
              <p>"The academy is innovating as a social enterprise itself, sharing its local model on an international level. Supported by Scottish Government and building on the work of British Council, the Academy was able to find an excellent partner to lead SEA China. We're looking forward to seeing what we can do together."</p>
              <p>Jufang Zhang, CEO of the Capacity Building &amp; Assessment Center, and now also SEA China, based in Beijing, said:</p>
              <p>"We're excited to be joining the SEA international network to promote learning between Scotland and China's social entrepreneurs. This will be a truly great collaboration."</p>
              <p>The Social Enterprise Academy, based in Edinburgh, provides leadership and entrepreneurship development programmes for social enterprises and young people. Its core aim is to help individuals use their own strengths to build sustainable enterprises and achieve greater social impact.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The most recent Social Enterprise Academy was launched with the creation of SEA India during the Deputy First Ministers visit there earlier this year.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
              <p>Serving social enterprises in communities across Scotland since 2004, the Social Enterprise Academy is now operated by local partners in ten countries worldwide including Australia, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Malawi.</p>

              <p>Detailed local area and equality group analysis was released today by Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician. The Scottish Surveys Core Questions 2016 tells us about age and gender groups, disabled people, ethnic and religious groups, LGB people and smaller regions of Scotland.</p>
              <p>The findings show a link between deprivation and poorer health outcomes. However since 2012, adults in the 20% most deprived areas were increasingly likely to report that the crime rate in their local area has stayed the same or fallen and have increased confidence in the police.</p>
              <p>Those in the most deprived areas are, compared to the Scottish population as a whole, more likely to be:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>under 35,</li>
              <li>disabled people</li>
              <li>Roman Catholic or Muslim</li>
              <li>from the White: Polish or the &ldquo;all other&rdquo; ethnic group (including those people identifying as mixed or multiple ethnic group, African, Caribbean or Black, Arab or &ldquo;Other&rdquo;)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Around a fifth of adults in Scotland smoke. Between 2012-2016 there has been a clear reduction in smoking rates across all ages under 75, both genders and all levels of deprivation. The &ldquo;White: Polish&rdquo; ethnic group has higher smoking rates than the Scottish national average. Smoking among the &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; group is lower than average, driven by a rate less than 5% among Asian women.</p>
              <p>Since 2012, there has been a reduction in the proportion of those aged 55 and over reporting long-term limiting health conditions. The rate of such conditions has increased among 16-24 year olds over the long term, likely associated with the increased survivability of childhood illnesses.</p>
              <p>People identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other sexual orientation reported poorer levels of general health, higher rates of long-term limiting health conditions and smoking and lower mental wellbeing scores compared to heterosexual people.</p>
              <p>Members of the Church of Scotland, Roman Catholics and &ldquo;Other Christian&rdquo; groups are more likely to report providing unpaid care compared to others.</p>

              <p>Total spend by Chinese visitors to Scotland has increased by 414% - from &pound;7 million to &pound;36 million since 2007.</p>
              <p>Over the same period, the number of visitors from China has increased by 192%, with 41,000 visits in 2016.</p>
              <p>The figures were highlighted by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in Beijing on the first full day of her visit to China. She attended an evening reception to preview a new global marketing campaign, launching later this week to invite people from around the world to live, work, visit and invest in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Tourism is a vital part of Scotland&rsquo;s economy, and these figures demonstrate the growing significance of Chinese visitors to our country.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is important we continue to build on this, particularly with the confirmation of the first direct air route beginning later this year. During my visit I will carry out engagements to further strengthen our relationship with China in a number of sectors, including tourism.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am travelling with the message that Scotland offers a warm welcome to all visitors, with our unique mix of history, stunning scenery and world-class culture and food and drink.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Increasing tourism deepens the friendship between our two nations, and this can only help firms who do business in China. The companies I met this evening are living proof that the world&rsquo;s second largest economy offers huge potential to Scottish businesses.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>People can now learn how to do CPR to the tune of the Proclaimer&rsquo;s hit &lsquo;I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)&rsquo;.</p>
              <p>The online film, funded by the Scottish Government and featuring Carole Smillie, has been created with the Save a Life for Scotland (SALFS) partnership.</p>
              <p>CPR can more than double the chances of survival following a cardiac arrest. The film is part of Scotland&rsquo;s Strategy for Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest - a five-year plan to equip 500,000 people with CPR skills and save an additional 1,000 lives by 2020.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the launch of the film at Braehead Shopping Centre in Glasgow, Health Secretary Shona Robison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;CPR saves lives and this film is a great way to learn those vital skills. The latest statistics show around half of adults in Scotland are confident giving CPR and to date more than 200,000 people across the country have learned CPR since 2015. This is testament to the work put in by SALFS partners, who have brought these lifesaving skills to people across the country.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Lisa MacInnes, Director of the Save a Life for Scotland campaign said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We hope that 500 miles will become the CPR anthem for a generation in Scotland. This familiar tune will remind us that CPR is the right thing to do and the beat helps us remember the right rhythm for chest compressions. Someone who is having a cardiac arrest needs help, you cannot make the situation worse for them. You can be the one to help buy them time until the ambulance arrives and save a life.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Paul Lucas, intu Braehead&rsquo;s operations manager said: &ldquo;This is a great initiative and we&rsquo;ll do all we can to help get the message out there. We hope lots of people learn how to carry out CPR, as that means they could save a life if someone has a cardiac arrest.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The film can be found at: <a href="https://youtu.be/KAu9l2pWOis">https://youtu.be/KAu9l2pWOis</a></p>
              <p>Around 3,500 people are treated annually by the Scottish Ambulance Service for a cardiac arrest and only 1 in 13 survive. A crucial factor is delay in treatment &ndash; for every 60 seconds that passes before CPR is performed, the chance of survival falls by 10 per cent.</p>
              <p>SALFS is a collaboration of emergency services, third sector organisations, community groups, academics, industry partners and the Scottish Government.</p>

              <p>A huge increase in&nbsp;childcare training places has been announced to help deliver the additional workforce required for the transformation of early learning and childcare in Scotland.&nbsp; The new training places are being made available in colleges and universities across Scotland in 2018/19.</p>
              <p>The annual letter of guidance issued earlier this week to the Scottish Funding Council highlighted the need to have a well-trained and diverse workforce to support children&rsquo;s early learning and childcare.</p>
              <p>Minister for Childcare and Early Years Maree Todd, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The near doubling of funded Early Learning and Childcare to ensure all children get the best possible start in life is a key priority for this Government. Expansion plans are now well underway to deliver this ambitious policy. In the coming year, the number of places for people to train in early learning qualifications at colleges and universities will significantly increase. Our colleges and universities attract talent from all over Scotland and have a key role to play to ensure that expanded early learning and childcare is delivered to the highest quality. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We know that the earliest years of life are crucial in every child&rsquo;s life, and the evidence tells us that if our early learning and childcare offer is to help give children the best start in life and contribute to closing the poverty-related attainment gap, it has to be of high quality.&nbsp;That is why we are determined to create a highly skilled, diverse and dedicated workforce, to ensure that quality is at the heart of our expansion plans.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Background </strong></p>
              <p>This increased provision of Early Learning and Childcare courses is a key aspect of our national recruitment campaign which seeks to attract people from a diverse range of backgrounds to pursue a career in the sector.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.childcarecareersscotland.scot">website</a> provides helpful information on how to pursue training and work opportunities in this area.</p>
              <p>The expansion of ELC is a key policy for the Scottish Government. Building on the increase in provision of training places over the previous academic year, a further increase in provision to support the expansion is sought for the 18/19 academic year.</p>
              <p>Specifically, we are seeking to train an additional 1,813 new starts for HNC college and university (through UHI) courses to train at practitioner level in the sector. We are also seeking an additional 490 places at managerial level. Those will be split between 388 BA Childhood Practice places &nbsp;at universities and 102 PDA places at colleges.</p>
              <p>This compares to an additional 650 practitioner level HNC courses and 350 managerial level courses (270 BA Childhood Practice and 80 PDAs) in 17/18</p>
              <p>Further information on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Letter of Guidance 2018-19 to the Scottish Funding Council can be found <a href="http://www.sfc.ac.uk/web/FILES/AboutUs/SFC_letter_of_guidance_2018-19.pdf">online</a>.</p>

              <p>Scottish students will get the opportunity to live and study in China through funding for the Confucius Institute for Scotland&rsquo;s Schools Scholarship Programme.</p>
              <p>The &pound;754,000 investment in the work of the Confucius Institute for Scotland&rsquo;s Schools (CISS) was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met some of the current scholars in Beijing on the first day of her visit to China. She learned how the scheme has helped to build links between young people in both countries, improving language skills and widening horizons for those taking part.</p>
              <p>Applications for the programme are open to 6th year pupils in Confucius Classroom Hubs around Scotland. So far 70 Scottish students have been awarded scholarships.</p>
              <p>The First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland and China have longstanding links which we want to strengthen and one of the most important ways in which we can do that is through education.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The work of the Confucius Institute for Scotland&rsquo;s schools has helped to engage more of our young people in learning about the culture, history and language of China, through the growing network of Confucius Classrooms.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It was fascinating to meet some of the current Confucius scholars &ndash; including two pupils from my former school - and hear about their experiences in China.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>CISS and Tianjin Education Commission have developed a scholarship programme which provides places for a number of Scottish students to study and live in China for one year.&nbsp; In 2017 and 2018 there are 22 places. CISS hope to extend the programme further for 2019.</p>
              <p>There are now 22 CISS classroom &ldquo;hubs&rdquo; in secondary schools across Scotland.&nbsp; The hubs promote joint planning of cultural activities, sharing ideas and resources to stimulate the learning and teaching of Chinese language and culture.&nbsp; A number of primary schools are now involved, enabling learning activities to reach a larger number of young people.</p>
              <p>Former Confucius scholar Grace Paterson, 21, a former pupil of Queen Anne High School in Dunfermline, is now studying Chinese language with business at Nankai University in Tianjin.</p>
              <p>She said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I have now lived and studied in Tianjin for almost three years and can confidently say it&rsquo;s been the best experience of my life. After a year of Chinese study I knew I hadn&rsquo;t had enough and have since been doing my undergraduate in Chinese language at Nankai University. The added bonus of being able to speak Chinese has totally changed my time here for the better as I&rsquo;ve been able to experience a more authentic side to the country, gain a deeper understanding of the people and culture and make friends from more countries than I can count. I have been given the opportunity to see for myself what kind of a country China is and I still have no plans to leave in the near future, I feel very comfortable to call Tianjin &lsquo;home&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Four specialist hubs at the Scottish Schools Football Association, the Royal Conservatoire, Scottish Opera and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (Edinburgh Zoo) are being launched this year. The hubs will do outreach work with schools to blend learning about Chinese culture and language through their area of expertise.</p>
              <p>The hub at Edinburgh Zoo is the first specialist Science Confucius Classroom Hub in the world.</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>In 2018/19 Scottish Government will provide &pound;754,000 in grant funding to the Confucius Institute for Scotland&rsquo;s schools and &pound;700,000 to Scotland&rsquo;s National Centre for Languages at Strathclyde University, where CISS is co-located. This funding builds on that awarded in previous years.</p>
              <p>The Confucius Institute for Scotland&rsquo;s Schools (CISS) at the University of Strathclyde was established in partnership with Tianjin Education Commission in 2012 with the aim of strengthening educational cooperation between China and Scotland.</p>

              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has hailed the &ldquo;astonishing&rdquo; growth in Scotland&rsquo;s food and drink exports to China &ndash; and said that strengthening international trade links are key to promoting inclusive economic growth, social justice and human rights around the world.</p>
              <p>Exports of food and drink to China have increased by more than 150% in the last 10 years, highlighting China&rsquo;s growing importance as a market for Scottish goods</p>
              <p>Scotch whisky exports accounted for the majority, worth some &pound;61 million - up 45% compared to 2007.</p>
              <p>Fish and seafood continues to be the primary food export to China, valued at about &pound;50 million&nbsp; in 2017 &ndash; up more than 12-fold compared to the value in 2007. China currently ranks ninth in Scotland&rsquo;s top ten food export markets.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>A range of Scottish industries and activities are experiencing growing interest from the Chinese market, and promoting these will be a key objective of the First Minister&rsquo;s first official visit to China in three years, which begins today (Sunday).</p>
              <p>The First Minister begins her visit in Beijing before visiting Shanghai and Hong Kong later this week. She will carry out a series of high-level government and business meetings, alongside cultural and educational engagements.</p>
              <p>The First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The astonishing growth in Scottish food and drink exports to China in recent years is testament not only to the high quality of our food and drink produce, but also a stark reminder of the huge opportunities open to us in the Chinese market.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Of course, food and drink is not the only sector that has been experiencing growing trade &ndash; total goods exports to China across the whole of the Scottish economy increased by more than 40% last year.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;My visit this week is an opportunity to further promote the best of Scotland in the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy. It will also help to deepen the long-standing cultural, education and tourism links that exist between Scotland and China.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that, for a country of 5 million people, Scotland punches well above its weight in terms of international brand recognition and cultural influence.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Making the most of these strengths is absolutely key to our future prosperity &ndash; but it can have much wider benefits as well. The more we can strengthen our overseas links and deepen our relationships, the more opportunity we have to promote our values of social justice and human rights around the world.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>A new multi-partner group is to be set up to explore all options to safeguard&nbsp;the future of the Pinney's factory, owned by Young&rsquo;s Seafood, and retain the jobs of the skilled and dedicated workforce.</p>
              <p>The group will visit the Pinney&rsquo;s site next week to meet with Young&rsquo;s Seafood management to explore a number of options for safeguarding jobs at the site.</p>
              <p>This will include options to retain the natural salmon production line at the plant, as well as exploring new market opportunities for retaining a more extensive Young's presence at the Pinney&rsquo;s site and, in the event this is not possible, to look at opportunities to attract and secure new investors to the site.</p>
              <p>The Group will also develop plans to support the workforce through this period, given concerns that will have been raised for individuals and their families, and to look at the implications for the associated supply chain serving the site currently and impacts on those wider communities in and around Annan.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Scottish Government Business Minister, Paul Wheelhouse, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I have had constructive discussions today with the leadership of Dumfries and Galloway Council, colleagues from Scottish Government and our enterprise and skills agencies, PACE officials and industry body Seafood Scotland, around the future of the Pinney&rsquo;s processing plant &lrm;and we agreed to leave no stone unturned to safeguard the future of the site and the employment of the workforce.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As part of these discussions, we agreed to set up an action group, consisting of those partners attending and others such as South of Scotland Economic Partnership, who will work with the management at Young&rsquo;s to explore all viable options to retain production at the site, with a focus on safeguarding as many jobs as possible. This group will help coordinate information flows to and from, and engagement with, elected members as they help support their constituents to help ensure a Team Annan approach is taken forward by all and our follow-on meeting with many elected members today was very helpful in starting that process.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;While this continues to be a very worrying time for Young&rsquo;s employees, their families and the wider community, the Scottish Government, our agencies and other local stakeholders, such as Dumfries and Galloway Council, are absolutely committed to working in partnership with Young&rsquo;s and their workforce and other stakeholders to get a positive outcome. I want to assure all those who are affected by this uncertainty at this time that we will do everything we can to both support them and to help find a solution, and we understand the need to maintain our early momentum.</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>This follows constructive meetings between Business Minister, Paul Wheelhouse; the leader and deputy leader of Dumfries &amp; Galloway Council; senior officials from the Council, the Scottish Government and its agencies; and Seafood Scotland, the leadership body for the seafood industry. &nbsp;The Minister and Leader and Deputy Leader of the Council met with MSPs, and local councillors following this meeting to brief them on next steps.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison has approved the appointment of John Brown CBE as interim Chair of NHS Tayside.</p>
              <p>Mr Brown, who is currently Chair of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, will take on the role on an interim basis until a substantive Chair can be appointed.</p>
              <p>The Health Secretary has also welcomed the NHS Scotland Chief Executive&rsquo;s decision to appoint Malcolm Wright as acting Chief Executive of NHS Tayside.</p>
              <p>NHS Scotland Chief Executive, Paul Gray, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As the Cabinet Secretary made clear, a change of leadership was needed within NHS Tayside to maintain public confidence.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These appointments will provide stability to the Board and enhance financial scrutiny, and their considerable experience in management and leading change will bring huge benefits. Most importantly, it will ensure that patient safety continues to be at the very heart of their work.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I will be going to NHS Tayside on Monday to meet the Board, and thank them for their continued efforts throughout this challenging time.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am pleased to approve the appointment of John Brown, and welcome the appointment of Malcolm Wright.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Mr Brown already chairs a large Health Board and is a chartered management accountant, with significant experience in leading change. Mr Wright is a very experienced NHS Chief Executive, and has already been involved in a number of successful Board transformations.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am confident that their appointments will bring a very valuable stability to the Board.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>John Brown will retain the role of Chair of Greater Glasgow and Clyde, but in the meantime will pass some of his duties to the Vice-Chair, Ross Finnie, and to NHS GG&amp;C sub-committee chairs, so that he can devote sufficient time to NHS Tayside, and to ensure continuity in GG&amp;C.</p>
              <p>Malcolm Wright will also remain as CEO of NHS Grampian. Amanda Croft, as Deputy CEO, will oversee the day-to-day operations of NHS Grampian.</p>
              <p>Professor Sir Lewis Ritchie will continue as Chair of the NHS Tayside Assurance Advisory Group, but with an expanded role focused on non-executive development and support.</p>
              <p>Subject to approval by the Parliamentary Bureau, the Cabinet Secretary will update Parliament through a Parliamentary statement following recess.</p>

              <p>Local authorities are set to benefit from extra funding to cover the cost of roads maintenance and make additional repairs to road surfaces, following the extended wintry weather.</p>
              <p>Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has taken the decision to allocate an additional &pound;10 million for all 32 councils, &nbsp;with the details of the distribution to be agreed with COSLA. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>Mr Mackay said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland experienced unprecedented levels of extreme weather in recent months, culminating in the issuing of our first-ever Red Alert for snow by the Met Office in late February.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The severe weather led to local authorities incurring unexpected additional costs to their maintenance budgets, and simultaneously caused more damage to Scotland&rsquo;s road network.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;By assisting councils to keep our road networks safe and efficient, we&rsquo;re not only improving conditions for road users, we&rsquo;re also extending the life span of that network &ndash; benefiting the wider economy.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have agreed a local government finance settlement of &pound;10.7 billion, which will provide a real terms boost in both revenue and capital spending to support local services, including winter maintenance.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>COSLA&rsquo;s Resources Spokesperson Councillor Gail Macgregor said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;During the severe weather Scotland experienced in February and March, local authorities worked tirelessly to ensure their communities were safe &ndash; clearing roads and pavements and making sure essential services reached our most vulnerable throughout.</p>
              <p>While Councils budget for the impacts of winter weather, the &lsquo;Beast from the East&rsquo; was unexpected and led to a significant financial strain.&nbsp;We are pleased that the Scottish Government have recognised the impact on Councils with this additional funding, however the financial toll will continue to be felt for some time.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Scotland is now a key location for many international firms, such as J.P. Morgan, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, NCR, Ingenico and Avaloq. J.P. Morgan&rsquo;s European Technology Centre in Glasgow is a key strategic technology hub with 1,300 employees.</p>
              <p>Deloitte&rsquo;s 2017 Global FinTech Hubs Federation report highlighted Edinburgh&rsquo;s high concentration of key elements, and outside London and the South East, Scotland has the most complete financial and business services industry cluster in the UK.</p>
              <p>Economy Secretary Keith Brown is in New York this week to mark the 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of Tartan Day. As part of his programme he met a number of senior financial services representatives at an event hosted by Aberdeen Standard Investments to advance opportunities with potential trade and investment partners.</p>
              <p>Mr Brown said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The financial services sector is transforming globally and this offers a wealth of opportunity for Fintech in Scotland which will open new markets and encourage innovation.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our universities have helped fuel this growth by supplying a pipeline of graduates with world-class technical skills. Scotland&rsquo;s universities are already leaders in many of the technologies that drive this transformation including artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The global financial services sector will continue to be transformed by technology. Scotland&rsquo;s focus on Fintech has created an environment that will help these firms evolve and support the growth of start-ups. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s strengths in the sector are largely based on its data expertise. The Edinburgh City Deal, with its focus on data-driven innovation, is a key element to the future growth of Fintech.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are building on our global reputation for banking, asset management and insurance, underpinned by academic and research expertise. Scotland has pride of place on the Fintech map and will retain this place at the forefront of the changing global financial landscape.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Mr Brown was joined by Chair of FinTech Scotland Stephen Ingledew.</p>
              <p>Mr Ingledew said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In these fast changing times Scotland punches well above its weight in Fintech. Driven largely by world renowned expertise in the use of Data, Scotland is rapidly establishing itself as a significant Fintech hub. Collaboration and inclusion are important parts of a vibrant Fintech ecosystem and Scotland offers this as well as global connectiveness and a diverse talented workforce that helps FinTechs to move fast and innovate.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Mr Brown also attended an investment event to promote the nearly &pound;2 billion capital investment opportunities currently presented in Scotland.</p>

              <p>More than two-thirds of taxpayers will pay less on their current income this year under Scotland&rsquo;s new tax bands<strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Changes to the Higher and Top rate tax bands, which take effect from today, also mean an additional &pound;428 million will be available in 2018/19 to invest in vital public services and the economy.</p>
              <p>Under the new system, low earning taxpayers are protected through the introduction of a new Starter Rate of tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The income tax system will also be more progressive, raising additional revenue through the introduction of a new Intermediate Rate of 21% and increases to the Higher and Top Rates, to 41% and 46%.</p>
              <p>As a result of these changes, and the increase in the personal allowance, all taxpayers earning up to &pound;33,000 - 70% of all taxpayers - will be protected from any increase. Those earning more than &pound;33,000 will pay only a proportionate amount more.</p>
              <p>A majority of taxpayers (55%) in Scotland will pay less income tax in 2018-19 than they would in the rest of the UK, while those who can afford to pay more will make a marginally higher contribution to support public services and investment in the economy.</p>
              <p>Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The new income tax rates and bands will make the system more progressive and deliver additional revenues to invest in public services and the economy.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This progressive approach to reforming income tax will not only protect the lowest earning taxpayers, but ensure 70% of Scottish taxpayers pay less tax this year than last year for a given income, while the majority of Scottish taxpayers will pay less than if they lived elsewhere in the UK.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These measures, combined with our investment in the NHS, the economy, infrastructure, education and essential public services, ensure Scotland will be the fairest taxed part of the UK and provide the best deal for taxpayers.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Health Secretary Shona Robison has announced that she will be exercising Ministerial powers of intervention and moving NHS Tayside to the highest level of escalation.</p>
              <p>She said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Issues over past few weeks have laid bare the extent of the problems facing NHS Tayside and the minutes of a meeting of Trustees in 2014 outline, in detail, the approval of the use of endowment funds by the Chief Executive.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It has become clear to me that the current structure of the Board cannot deliver the improvements required to return to a sustainable position, while continuing to deliver safe and effective services to patients. In particular, I have concerns about the overall management of the Board&rsquo;s finances and the ability of leadership to carry through the change required to bring the Board back into financial balance.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As such, I will be exercising Ministerial powers of intervention and moving NHS Tayside to the highest level of escalation and I have instructed the Chief Executive of NHS Scotland to strengthen the leadership of NHS Tayside with immediate effect.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is imperative that all Boards use charitable donations for the purposes of which they were given. At my request, the Chief Executive of NHS Scotland has written to every NHS Board Chair seeking assurance that endowment monies are being spent for the correct purposes.&nbsp; We are also engaging directly with OSCR on this issue.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>If the Cabinet Secretary is of the opinion that any functions of a health board are not being exercised adequately Ministers have the power of intervention under the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978.</p>

              <p>Ministers have published proposed changes to the Councillors&rsquo; Code of Conduct that will explicitly prohibit harassment and bullying.</p>
              <p>The amended Code has been submitted to the Scottish Parliament for approval following its endorsement by COSLA. This brings the Councillors&rsquo; Code in line with recent changes to the Scottish Ministerial Code.</p>
              <p>Councillors have also agreed to update guidance on acceptable behaviour to accompany the changes to the Code.</p>
              <p>Minister for Local Government and Housing, Kevin Stewart said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Despite the great progress that has been made in promoting and achieving equality, it is clear that harassment and bullying are still issues that need tackled and this is unacceptable.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Government works for the people and we need to be unequivocal that prejudice of any kind will not be tolerated. The proposed changes to the Councillors&rsquo; Code mean that it will specifically condemn harassment and bullying and make clear that where behaviour falls short people can expect to be held to account.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>COSLA President Councillor, Alison Evison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This change sends a strong message that all forms of bullying and harassment are not only completely unacceptable but are considered a breach of the Code of Conduct. It is only right that elected members in all spheres of government are held equally to account for their behaviour and set a high example to the rest of society.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The change to the Code of Conduct is an important part of a wider picture such as continued efforts by COSLA and the Scottish Government to tackle gender based violence, including harassment, through the Equally Safe strategy.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>If agreed by Parliament the changes to <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2018/04/6836">the Code</a> are expected to come into force in the summer.</p>
              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The amendment states that &lsquo;bullying or harassment is completely unacceptable and will be considered to be a breach of this Code&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The changes have been endorsed by the Standards Commission and the Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life, the independent bodies responsible for enforcing the Code, as well as by COSLA.&nbsp; Similar changes to the Scottish Ministerial Code were issued by the First Minister in February.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>

              <p>Low-income families with young children will receive increased payments, digital smartcards and access to a wider range of foods, under new proposals.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government is consulting on plans to reshape the Welfare Foods Scheme, which aims to help families access a healthy diet.</p>
              <p>The plans include changing from paper Healthy Start food vouchers to smartcards for easier use and to reduce stigma, as well as cutting the administration involved for retailers. Families&rsquo; allowances would rise from &pound;3.10 to &pound;4.25 a week, and from &pound;899 to &pound;1,011 in total over the period they receive support.</p>
              <p>The range of foods covered by the system will also expand, while it is proposed to add a healthy snack to the free milk children receive at nurseries.</p>
              <p>Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Central to our aim of improving Scotland&rsquo;s health and tackling inequality is ensuring everyone can have a healthy diet, especially families with young children. There is strong evidence that diet impacts on children&rsquo;s health, their ability to learn and their life chances as they grow up.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;For too many families, poverty and deprivation are daily barriers to eating healthily. Our plans set out how we can further support families to make healthier choices, ensure the system is as easy as possible to use, while reducing stigma and increasing take-up.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Rosie Dodds, an independent Nutritionist from First Steps Nutrition Trust, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I warmly welcome these proposals to increase the value of the Healthy Start voucher. Far too many parents with young children experience food insecurity and skip meals to feed their children. I hope there will be many contributions to the consultation as well as work to ensure that all eligible families receive this help to buy healthy foods.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Maggie Simpson, chief executive of Scottish Childminding Association, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;SCMA is pleased to support the proposal to retain free milk for all services providing care to children under five, including childminders. Extending this entitlement to include a healthy snack is something we are very much in favour of.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Childminders play a key role in encouraging healthy eating, as we know the eating habits developed in early years often continue into adulthood. This is an ideal opportunity for childcare providers to support healthy food choices.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Access the <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/health-protection/welfare-foods/">consultation on Welfare Foods</a>.</p>
              <p>Powers over Welfare Foods have been devolved to Scotland under the Scotland Act 2016. These powers have not yet commenced and this consultation seeks views on how to best take forward those powers.</p>

              <p>After a meeting with Young's Seafood, Business Minister Paul Wheelhouse said:&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Following on from the very disappointing news that emerged from Young&rsquo;s Seafood, regarding their Pinney&rsquo;s seafood processing plant in Annan, I have had a constructive discussions with both the management at Young&rsquo;s and the leadership of Dumfries and Galloway Council.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I confirmed that the Scottish Government, our agencies and other local stakeholders are all committed to working in partnership with Young&rsquo;s to explore any potential options to retain production at the site and safeguard as many jobs as possible. We seek to leave no stone unturned in our efforts to retain employment, given the importance of the plant to the economic wellbeing of the community.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Young&rsquo;s have provided a detailed insight into those factors underlying the proposal to potentially close the site, and signalled their agreement to work with us, throughout and beyond the forthcoming consultation period with their staff, to explore all viable options, including the prospect of identifying new market opportunities and the potential reconfiguration of the site, to sustain production levels in Annan.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;While this will clearly be a very worrying time for Young&rsquo;s employees, their families and the wider community, I want to assure all those who are affected by this that we are committed to doing everything we can to find a viable solution. &nbsp;Furthermore, we will convene a meeting later this week with our partners at Dumfries and Galloway Council and other partner enterprise and skills agencies to map out the next steps in our efforts to try to save jobs at Pinney&rsquo;s and to ensure we work together, as a team, in the best interests of the people of Annan.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Islay will be next in line for a new ferry to support the island&rsquo;s growing economy, Minister for Transport and the Islands Humza Yousaf has pledged.</p>
              <p>Transport Scotland officials are currently investigating the potential design of the new vessel with Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) and CalMac Ferries.</p>
              <p>Mr Yousaf said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The next vessel procurement exercise will be for a new ferry for Islay to replace the MV Hebridean Isles. This will maintain our investment programme, currently focused on the construction of two major vessels for the CalMac fleet and a number of major harbour projects.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Islay route is already one of the busiest services for freight on the Clyde and Hebrides network, and we want to make sure we support this vital economic activity and help it grow.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;My officials are investigating potential designs and there will also be discussions with the island community at the appropriate point.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This summer will see changes to Islay service timetables on a Wednesday and Saturday, providing additional sailings to increase capacity, but we will continue to keep an eye on the performance of the route during this busy period.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The Help to Buy (Scotland) scheme will be extended beyond 2019, helping more people purchase a new-build home without the need for a large deposit.</p>
              <p>From April 2019, a further &pound;100 million will be invested over two years, helping up to 4,000 households to purchase a new home.</p>
              <p>Since 2013, the scheme has supported more than 12,000 households into a new home.</p>
              <p>Housing Minister Kevin Stewart made the announcement during a visit to Calderwood Village, Coatbridge.</p>
              <p>Mr Stewart said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Since we introduced Help to Buy, the scheme has not only helped thousands of &nbsp;buyers into new homes - it has supported around 9,000 jobs.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;A third of the annual &pound;50 million budget &ndash; &pound;18 million &ndash; will be reserved for sales from SME builders, who were particularly affected by the drop in development finance after the financial crisis.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We know house builders still see Scotland as a place to continue to develop and invest, with the latest figures showing new house completions grew by 5% over the last year.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Housing is about more than bricks and mortar &ndash; we want to provide safe, warm homes, help create a fairer Scotland, and preserve a diverse and more resilient construction sector.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Nicola Barclay, Chief Executive of Homes for Scotland, which represents companies building the majority of the country&rsquo;s homes, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;With most Scots wanting to own their own home and the scheme proven to increase build rates, this is a very welcome announcement. It clearly demonstrates that the Scottish Government supports the aspiration of home ownership and recognises the real challenge that continues to face prospective buyers in terms of the size of deposit they require to achieve this goal.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This additional funding will provide our member companies with the certainty that they need to invest in and open up new sites and expand the number of homes available to new purchasers.&nbsp;Crucially, just as the scheme&rsquo;s extension will ensure even more people can buy a home, it will also ease pressure in other parts of the housing market as people move into home ownership from socially rented homes and come off council house waiting lists.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background </strong></p>
              <p><a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/homeowners/help-to-buy/">Help to Buy (Scotland)</a> is open to first time buyers and existing homeowners, and provides up to 15% of the purchase price of a new build home.&nbsp; The maximum purchase price is &pound;200,000.</p>
              <p><a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/more-homes/">More Homes Scotland</a>&nbsp;is the overarching approach to bring together all activity to increase supply.</p>
              <p>Around two thirds (66%) of Help to Buy (Scotland) households were first time buyers, whilst around a third (34%) were existing home owners.</p>
              <p>Around half (50%) of buyers were aged 30 years or under, with over three-quarters (76%) of buyers aged 35 or under.</p>
              <p>Help to Buy (Scotland) was launched on 30 September 2013.&nbsp; &pound;313 million was invested during the first three years (2013/14 &ndash; 2015/16) of the scheme.&nbsp; A further &pound;195 million was committed from 2016/17 - 2018/19.</p>

              <p>The Scottish economy grew by 0.3% during the fourth quarter of 2017, according to statistics announced today by Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician.</p>
              <p>This is the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth in Scotland and compared to the same quarter last year, the Scottish economy has grown by 1.1%. Therefore taken over the year, annual GDP has also increased by 0.8% in 2017, improving on Scotland&rsquo;s economic performance in 2016 where GDP grew by 0.2%.</p>
              <p>In the latest quarter, growth was driven by a number of sectors, with the largest contributions from Business Services and Finance, Distribution, Hotels &amp; Catering, Manufacturing, and Electricity &amp; Gas Supply.&nbsp; Overall the Services sector grew by 0.5%, and the Production sector grew by 0.9%.&nbsp; Whilst Construction sector output fell by 2.6% it remains around 15% higher than at the beginning of 2014.</p>
              <p>Minister for Employability and Training Jamie Hepburn said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;With four consecutive quarters of positive growth in 2017, Scotland&rsquo;s economy continues to show strength.&nbsp; Compared to the same point in 2016, Scotland&rsquo;s economy grew by 1.1%, growing 0.3% during the final quarter of 2017.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These figures are welcome, but we are determined to do more to grow our economy and protect Scotland from the headwinds of Brexit.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government is investing a record &pound;2.4 billion in enterprise and skills, &pound;4 billion in new infrastructure and &pound;600 million in broadband, to ensure every home or business premise in Scotland has access to superfast broadband and that we can secure the benefits of the digital economy - a commitment unmatched across the UK.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;And we are preparing for the future with investments in a new National Manufacturing Institute and the establishment of the Scottish National Investment Bank.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As we face the potential impact of Brexit to come, the Scottish Government is determined to protect Scotland&rsquo;s economy and ensure our potential is not derailed by damaging decisions of the UK Government.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Scottish Government support is enabling the world&rsquo;s leading supplier of mobile power generators to develop lower carbon solutions &ndash; and increase its Scottish workforce.</p>
              <p>Scottish Enterprise have awarded Aggreko UK a &pound;1.5 million research and development (R&amp;D) grant for three projects, which will see the company invest &pound;33 million in its Dumbarton facility and create 23 new jobs.</p>
              <p>Aggreko are to design and build a new range of power generators, which are more efficient, have significantly lower emissions and utilise cheaper and alternative fuels.</p>
              <p>The three projects being supported by the grant seek to:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Expand the use of solar-diesel hybrid energy storage products</li>
              <li>Develop new methods to use waste heat to provide additional energy</li>
              <li>Create more energy-efficient diesel and gas fuel solutions</li>
              </ul>
              <p>As First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited Aggreko&rsquo;s Lomondgate site in Dumbarton, she said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our aspiration is for Scotland to once again be the inventor and manufacturer of the innovations that shape the future. That is why our Programme for Government saw business R&amp;D grants boosted by 70%. Therefore, I am delighted this funding is having an impact on firms like Aggreko, setting the pace for ambitious, innovative businesses all over the country.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;With 23 highly skilled jobs being created in Dumbarton and significant investment by the company, it is hugely encouraging that Aggreko regard Scotland as the perfect place for them to grow their business.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As our new Energy Strategy sets out, it is crucial that we find new ways to ensure energy is produced efficiently, and integrates renewable and low carbon technology &ndash; as is the case with these developments by Aggreko.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Chris Weston, CEO, Aggreko, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Power generation and energy markets are going through a fundamental change and businesses, organisations and governments across the globe are having to respond rapidly to this changing energy landscape.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government has identified the need for a low-carbon economy and increased innovation as a top priority. We are delighted with the support Scottish Enterprise has shown by contributing funding towards our Future Technology initiative.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Linda Hanna, Managing Director of Scottish Enterprise, added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;By bringing our support to these projects we can help Aggreko maximise its innovation, continue to anchor itself in Scotland and further increase Scotland&rsquo;s reputation as a global energy hub.&nbsp; I wish Aggreko every success with its ambitious plans and look forward to continuing to work together to deliver its full growth potential.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p><a href="https://www.aggreko.com/en-gb">Aggreko</a> is the global leader in the rental of power and temperature control systems. They have been operational in Scotland since 1973 and employ 502 people here, including 240 at the Lomondgate facility in Dumbarton.</p>

              <p>The success of Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games continues to draw world-class events, tourists and spending to Scotland, says a new report on its legacy.</p>
              <p>The final Games legacy evaluation says Scotland has an enhanced international reputation for sports and culture, and since 2014 has secured 65 UK and international level sports events worth &pound;27.5 million. Games venues and infrastructure also attract cultural events and business conferences and conventions, and tourists with them.</p>
              <p>The report also says:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The Games drove the development of high-quality sports facilities across Scotland and there are now over 180 community sports hubs</li>
              <li>Local people are frequently using Games venues, more people are using Glasgow Life venues and there are more opportunities to engage in sport</li>
              <li>Residents in Glasgow&rsquo;s regenerated East End are more satisfied and feel safer and more involved in decisions that affect their area</li>
              <li>People living in the former Athlete&rsquo;s Village are very satisfied with their houses and neighbourhood</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The evaluation confirms that between 2007 and 2014 the preparation and delivery of the Games contributed &pound;740 million to Scotland&rsquo;s economy, including &pound;390 million to Glasgow, and supported an average of 2,100 jobs a year. Also published are reports on the impact on the health and wellbeing of Glasgow&rsquo;s East End communities and the experience of Games volunteers.</p>
              <p>Sport Minister Aileen Campbell said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Glasgow&rsquo;s Commonwealth Games was the largest sporting and cultural event ever held in Scotland and was declared the best games ever. The event has been recognised internationally as an example of&nbsp;strong leadership, planning and partnerships. It has changed the lives of thousands of people.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;What is clear from today&rsquo;s report is that this incredible fortnight has had a lasting impact on Scotland and created a legacy that will bring social, cultural and economic benefits for years to come. The experience has also put Scotland and Glasgow in a great position to host major events, such as developing and co-hosting the new 2018 European Championships with Berlin this summer.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Glasgow City Council Depute Leader Cllr David McDonald said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games was a real catalyst for securing social, cultural and economic benefits for our city and for Scotland. Some of that legacy is obvious right now: in the major sporting and cultural events we attract and their positive economic impact; in our world-class venues, and in the improvements to communities and infrastructure, particularly in the East End. These are life-changing improvements that add up to better jobs and better opportunities for Glaswegians.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There are other elements of the Games legacy that target fundamental social change. They require a long-term commitment and must be maintained, supported and nurtured, and that is exactly what we are doing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive, and former Glasgow 2014 chief executive, David Grevemberg, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Dynamic, engaged, ambitious host cities and nations are the heartbeat of the Commonwealth Sports Movement - and Glasgow and Scotland put all their pride and passion in to ensuring the benefits of the Games stretched far beyond 11 days of spectacular sport. They were widely and rightly regarded as a new Commonwealth benchmark, raising the bar for future hosts. Today, with the Gold Coast 2018 opening ceremony about to take place, it&rsquo;s inspiring proof of the impact and importance of Commonwealth sport.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Low income families will have greater access to affordable credit through a new &pound;2 million fund.</p>
              <p>Announced as part of the Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan, the Scottish Government will provide &pound;1 million to the Carnegie Trust&rsquo;s Affordable Credit Loan Fund, doubling the size of the fund.</p>
              <p>This support could help grow the sector, opening up more options for those that need affordable credit, reducing the cost of borrowing and making sure that people can access financial products and services that meet their needs in a responsible way.</p>
              <p>Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Insecurity of income is one of the biggest challenges faced by those in poverty.&nbsp; By investing &pound;1 million in the Carnegie Trust&rsquo;s Affordable Credit Loan Fund, we are doubling the amount available for social lenders to offer affordable loans.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are showing how Scotland is leading the way on tackling the problem of access to affordable credit. We want to provide a clear alternative to organisations, such as payday lenders, that can often charge extortionate interest rates and can leave people trapped in a cycle of debt.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We will continue to work with the Carnegie UK Trust and the community lending sector to ensure that everyone who needs it has access to the financial products they need to help them get on in life.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Martyn Evans, Chief Executive of the Carnegie UK Trust, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The launch of the first Child Poverty Delivery Plan is a hugely significant milestone in the drive to eradicate child poverty in Scotland. At present, those in poverty have to pay a significant premium whenever they borrow money. This has to change. We need to make more affordable, socially-motivated credit, linked to other services, far more widely available. We are therefore delighted that the Delivery Plan includes a commitment to invest in the Carnegie Affordable Credit Loan Fund and provide new investment to those not-for-profit lenders giving people a much fairer deal.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Actor and activist Michael Sheen said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;High cost credit can be really detrimental to people&rsquo;s finances and their wellbeing. Tackling the problem is complex and a vital part of the solution must be to provide people with fairer, more affordable borrowing alternatives which are delivered for social good. We need to make these alternatives much more widely available than they are currently, so that all who need them can benefit from them.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government&rsquo;s investment in the Carnegie Affordable Credit Loan Fund is a hugely welcome announcement to help grow the affordable credit sector in Scotland and achieve this goal. &nbsp;Through the End High Cost Credit Alliance that I&rsquo;ve founded I am looking forward to working closely with partners in Scotland to help make more affordable credit available for all.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Two of Scotland&rsquo;s key organisations to support victims of human trafficking will share &pound;3,113,352 over three years to increase the care they can provide.</p>
              <p>The significant increase in funding for Migrant Help and TARA (Trafficking Awareness Raising Alliance) comes in the same week that regulations to increase the minimum period of support for trafficking victims come into force. The support period has been doubled to 90 days.</p>
              <p>The number of trafficking referrals to Police Scotland has also been steadily increasing in recent years, and saw a 38% rise in 2017, following work to raise awareness and improve reporting.</p>
              <p>Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Human trafficking is an appalling abuse of human rights. This horrific crime affects the most vulnerable in society and has lasting consequences for its victims. Some will need long term care and support following their ordeal, meaning that we must do everything we can to aid victims.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;An increase in the statutory minimum period of support will mean that trafficked individuals will receive care over a longer term period, which will greatly aid their rehabilitation.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This increase in funding in 2018/19 will also allow Migrant Help and TARA to increase capacity and resilience to deal with both the increase in referrals and the greater care victims will receive.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Bronagh Andrew of TARA said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Women require long term help to recover from the abuse they have survived and this increase in resources will enable us to continue to improve our efforts to establish a solid foundation to help women on their journey.&nbsp;Women have told us that support needs to be ongoing and that they value the assistance they receive.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;Phil Dailly, Migrant Help&rsquo;s National Operations Manager said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Migrant Help welcomes the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting victims of human trafficking and believes that by working together we can help eradicate this abhorrent crime.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are very happy to continue our partnership with the Scottish Government which enables us to support and empower survivors of human trafficking. The longer support period will have a positive impact on our clients&rsquo; recovery. It will give us more time to address individual needs and enable them to regain confidence and prepare for a new positive chapter in their lives.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>TARA and Migrant Help support suspected victims of trafficking identified in Scotland. TARA support adult female survivors of trafficking for sexual exploitation; Migrant Help support all other adult victims.</p>
              <p>Funding for both bodies over the next three years is outlined below. in 2017/18 they received &pound;317,510 and &pound;465,454 respectively.</p>

              <p>The new GP contract for Scotland comes into force today.</p>
              <p>Backed by investment of &pound;110 million in 2018-19 and jointly developed with the BMA, it will ensure GPs can spend more time with the patients who need them most by ensuring patients can access the right person at the right time.</p>
              <p>Over the next three years, it will expand the team of healthcare professionals working in general practice such as practice nurses, physiotherapists and pharmacists.</p>
              <p>A new short life working group, chaired by Professor Sir Lewis Ritchie, is also being established to ensure the contract is delivered in a way that works well for rural and remote parts of the country.</p>
              <p>Cabinet Secretary for Health, Shona Robison, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This new contract will mean those who need to see a doctor get more time for consultation and that other patients get better access to specialist support quickly.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It will also help to cut doctors&rsquo; workload, ensure a minimum income guarantee for GPs and make general practice an even more attractive career, which will contribute to our commitment to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over ten years to ensure a sustainable service that meets increasing demand.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our commitment to invest &pound;7.5 million to support GP recruitment and retention, including &pound;850,000 in increased support to expand the remote and rural incentive scheme and relocation funds, will have a positive impact for rural GPs.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The new remote and rural short life working group will also ensure the contract is delivered in a way that works well for rural communities and look at what more can be done to support rural general practice.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This investment is part of a wider commitment to increase general practice funding by &pound;250 million by 2021 as part of an extra investment of &pound;500 million per year for primary care funding. This will raise the primary care budget from 7.7% to 11% of the total NHS frontline budget.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The GP contract was formally accepted on 18<sup>th</sup> January 2018. <a href="https://news.gov.scot/news/historic-new-gp-contract-agreed">https://news.gov.scot/news/historic-new-gp-contract-agreed</a></p>

              <p>Significant new rights improving support and recognition for unpaid cares have come into force.</p>
              <p>Under the Carers (Scotland) Act, all people who provide unpaid care for friends, family, and neighbours will now have the right to a personalised plan. This will identify their needs and help them access information, advice and support, before reaching a crisis point.</p>
              <p>Local authorities and health boards will work together to prepare local carer strategies, setting out their plans for identifying and supporting carers in their community. The Act also ensures carers will be involved in individual decisions about their own support and what happens when the person they look after is discharged from hospital</p>
              <p>Under the new rights, the definition of a carer will be extended, with the removal of the requirement for &lsquo;substantial caring on a regular basis&rsquo;, meaning more people will be able to access this support.</p>
              <p>Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Carers play a vital role in Scottish society, providing millions of hours of unpaid care a week for friends, family and neighbours. We owe them an enormous debt of gratitude.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is vital that all carers receive the support they need to look after their own health and wellbeing, and have a life alongside caring. That is what the Carers Act will deliver.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our reforms will significantly boost the rights of carers and ensure that health boards, local authorities and others are doing all they can to identify and support the carers in their area. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Crucially, that means having their own needs identified and addressed, and being involved in decisions about their own support as well as the needs of the person they care for.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>There are an estimated 788,000 carers in Scotland, including 44,000 who are under 18. The value of care they provide is estimated at over &pound;10 billion a year.</p>

              <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s small grant funding will enable artisans in rural Kenya to promote their cultural heritage, boosting tourism and benefitting the economy.</p>
              <p>Focused on unlocking the potential of cultural tourism within deprived areas in Kenya, the pilot will work to harness the skills, knowledge and rich cultural history of these communities.</p>
              <p>This is one of the 12 projects to be delivered by Scottish-based NGOs in 2018-19 through a share of &pound;354,000 funding from the Small Grants Programme.</p>
              <p>International Development Minister Alasdair Allan said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;For the last five years, our small grants have enabled Scottish agencies to make a significant impact and help some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable communities.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am delighted that, through these projects, we will continue to improve the lives of those facing hardship and poverty in Kenya and in all our partner countries, making a sustained difference.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Mara Menzies, Trustee at The Global Concerns, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are delighted to be awarded a feasibility grant from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Small Grants Programme, which will assist us enormously in ensuring that the project has a long-term, sustainable future.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Over the years, Scottish Government grants have enabled us to develop pioneering projects in India and Malawi, benefitting thousands of people at a grassroots level, both in Scotland and internationally. The funding has enabled us to support and empower women, children, persons with disabilities and rural communities, making a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Jane Salmonson, Chief Executive at Scotland's International Development Alliance, added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government is unique as a donor in its commitment to making grants to small international organisations. It has proved year after year how relatively small sums can achieve significant results overseas, while helping our own international organisations here in Scotland to develop and grow.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The International Development Small Grants Programme is open to Scottish-based Non-Government Organisations (NGOs). Under the programme, &pound;354,860 has been allocated to fund <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/small-grants-programme-2018-2019/">12 projects</a> across Malawi, Rwanda, Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania.</p>
              <p>International development charity The <a href="http://www.globalconcernstrust.org.uk/">Global Concerns Trust</a>, which supports grassroots development and environmental projects in Africa and Asia, has been awarded &pound;9,517 to deliver their feasibility study in Kenya in 2018-19.</p>

              <p>Parents of premature and sick newborn babies will receive help meeting the additional costs they face as a result of their baby being in hospital with the introduction of a new &pound;1.5 million fund.</p>
              <p>From 1 April, the Neonatal Expenses Fund will be available to all parents to support them to spend as much time with their babies as possible, while they are receiving care within a neonatal unit.</p>
              <p>The fund will help more than 8,000 families a year with travelling, parking and subsistence costs.</p>
              <p>As Health Secretary Shona Robison met new parents at the Simpson&rsquo;s Centre for Reproductive Health at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, she said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Having a premature or sick baby is a hugely testing and emotional time for parents. We want to ensure they are supported and involved as possible in decision-making around their baby&rsquo;s care, and have more opportunities to bond as a family during these early days.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;For some parents, getting to and from the hospital every day can be a big additional expense and this is where the Neonatal Expenses Fund can help. Easing the pressure of being able to afford to get to your baby will, I hope, be one less thing for parents in this situation to worry about.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Dr Sarah Stock, Consultant Obstetrician at NHS Lothian and&nbsp;Senior Clinical Lecturer at MRC Centre for Reproductive Health,&nbsp;University of Edinburgh, said: &ldquo;We recently launched a specialist service for women who are at higher risk of giving birth before full term.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are trying to understand the factors associated with early birth and interventions that might help to prolong pregnancy, so that every baby has the best chance of being born healthy. The clinic &ndash; supported by Tommy&rsquo;s, the baby charity &ndash; is the first of its kind in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Professor Ben Stenson, Clinical Lead of Neonatal Services in NHS Lothian, said: &ldquo;We know how vital it is for parents to spend as much time as possible with their babies when they are being cared for in Neonatal units. It allows them to be involved in the clinical decisions being taken about their care and helps them create a bond with their baby.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It can be a challenging and emotional time for parents and one that that very often they could not have forseen or planned ahead for. This fund may help to ease any financial worries and allow them to make the journeys to hospital as often as they would like so they can concentrate on being a new parent.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/neonatal-expenses-fund/">Neonatal Expenses Fund</a> is designed to provide a contribution towards the cost of having a baby within neonatal care.</p>
              <p>The Best Start recommended that a national agreed policy should be developed to support parents financially during this difficult time.</p>
              <p>Funds are distributed to each NHS Board in Scotland, with all claims being made through each board.</p>
              <p>Families will be able to claim for travel costs of 1 return journey, parking and up to &pound;8.50 in subsistence costs per day for the duration of their baby&rsquo;s stay in the neonatal unit.</p>
              <p>One in eight babies born in the UK each year are admitted onto neonatal units.</p>

              <p>Businesses across Scotland are to benefit from a fairer rates system.</p>
              <p>The changes introduced in response to the Barclay Review will stimulate the economy, reduce red tape, improve transparency and reduce tax avoidance.</p>
              <p>From 1 April, there will be no business rates for unoccupied new properties and tenants who take them on will be rates-free for the first year. Where properties are improved, they will not pay any additional rates as a result of the improvement for 12 months.</p>
              <p>Eligible childcare day nurseries will receive up to 100% relief, in a move designed to support nursery provision throughout Scotland by reducing overheads for nursery owners - savingthe sector around &pound;6 million next year</p>
              <p>Finance Secretary Derek Mackay marked the start of the new policies by visiting The Orchard Nursery in Edinburgh.</p>
              <p>He said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These changes &ndash; many of which are unique to Scotland - will help our businesses to continue to thrive while also ensuring they make an appropriate contribution to important local services.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;When I appointed Ken Barclay to review the rates system, I tasked him with</p>
              <p>&nbsp;updating it to better support business growth, encourage long-term investment and enable businesses to better navigate fast-changing marketplaces.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The changes we put in place &ndash; in many ways going further than the Barclay recommendations &ndash; also allowed us to offer wider benefits, such as supporting the expansion in funded early learning and childcare entitlement with the relief for nurseries.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been impressed with what I&rsquo;ve seen at The Orchard nursery and hearing how they intend to use the savings they will make next year.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Orchard Nursery owner Vicky Coia said: &ldquo;We are pleased the Scottish Government has led the way by creating business rate relief for the nursery sector across Scotland. It will allow us to invest in more training, staffing and resources to enhance staff practice and the opportunities and experiences we offer the children and their families.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Andy Willox, the FSB&rsquo;s Scottish policy convenor, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These new measures from the Scottish Government take us a step closer to developing a fairer, smarter rates system. FSB made the case for these changes in our submission to the recent rates review, and we&rsquo;re pleased to see Ministers turn them into real help for local firms.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Local nurseries are a prime example of smaller businesses that are fundamental to the success of their local community and economy. This new rates help should ensure that they aren&rsquo;t penalised because they operate from specialised premises.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;At FSB, we&rsquo;re firmly of the belief that if a business makes an improvement to their property they should be given an opportunity to recoup their costs before facing a higher bill. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s new business accelerator relief does exactly that.&rdquo;<br /> </p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="https://news.gov.scot/news/making-scotland-the-best-place-to-invest">Barclay changes</a> were announced by Mr Mackay in September.</p>
              <p>This followed the <a href="https://news.gov.scot/news/issued-on-behalf-of-the-barclay-review-group">Barclay Recommendations</a> by former RBS Chair Ken Barclay, after he was <a href="https://news.gov.scot/news/business-rates-review">appointed by the First Minister</a>.</p>
              <p>Together with the Small Business Bonus Scheme, the rates changes will mean firms make savings of &pound;226 million this year.</p>

              <p>Veterans are set to benefit from initiatives to improve employment opportunities and help transition after serving.</p>
              <p>Awards made to veterans and ex-services charities across Scotland from the Scottish Veterans Fund (SVF) now total more than &pound;1.3 million.</p>
              <p>Grant funding of &pound;204,000 has been newly allocated to ten projects across Scotland to encourage employment opportunities for veterans, help them develop key skills when transitioning and improve community support. Six projects which continue from last year will also be given &pound;67,000 in 2018/19.</p>
              <p>This funding includes &pound;93,000 from Standard Life Aberdeen, over the next two years, who continue to partner with the Scottish Government to enhance the fund.</p>
              <p>On a visit to the Whitefoord House Scottish Veterans Residence (SVR) in Edinburgh, which has been awarded &pound;3,268 to provide veterans living in supported accommodation with the skills to prepare nutritious food safely and to manage a budget for a healthy diet, the Scottish Veterans Minister Keith Brown said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want to make Scotland the destination of choice for those leaving the Armed Forces, and their families. We want to support veterans, and enable them to realise their potential. The Scottish Veterans Fund provides vital funding to projects that promote employment and skills development, as well as creating opportunities for social inclusion.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to thank Standard Life Aberdeen for their continued support, which makes it possible for these fantastic projects to make a real, positive difference to the lives of ex-servicemen and women.</p>
              <p>Sandy MacDonald, Head of Sustainability at Standard Life Aberdeen, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;At Standard Life Aberdeen, we&rsquo;ve seen first-hand the hugely positive impact that armed forces veterans bring to our workplace and community. We&rsquo;re proud to be continuing our commitment to The Scottish Veterans Fund, and it&rsquo;s great to see that such fantastic projects are going to be receiving this vital support.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The Scottish Veterans Commissioner, Eric Fraser said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am delighted that the Scottish Government and Standard Life Aberdeen are continuing their support for our veterans community through the Scottish Veterans Fund. There are many innovative and exciting projects this year which will make a real difference and help even more veterans fulfil their potential.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Established in 2008, the Scottish Veterans Fund has now invested over &pound;1.3 million to over 150 projects since 2008. The &pound;204,453 funding allocation was awarded following consideration by the Scottish Veterans Fund panel chaired by the Scottish Veterans Commissioner.</p>

              <p>The group overseeing Scotland&rsquo;s aim of having the cleanest air in Europe has been strengthened with specialists in health, environmental science and regulation.</p>
              <p>British Heart Foundation Scotland (BHF) and Professor Campbell Gemmell, an expert in environmental science, policy and regulation, have joined The Cleaner Air for Scotland Governance Group. The group oversees the delivery of Scotland&rsquo;s strategy for cutting air pollution and reducing its impact on health.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government has also set out further details of the financial support that will be made available for Low Emission Zones (LEZs). Over 70% of the &pound;10.8m funding in 2018/19 will support the bus industry in Glasgow to prepare for LEZs. This is enough to support the retrofitting of over 300 buses, more than 40% of the city centre fleet. Exhaust retrofitting ensures that the buses meet the latest environmental standards.</p>
              <p>Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am delighted to welcome the British Heart Foundation Scotland and Professor Campbell Gemmell to the Cleaner Air for Scotland Governance Group. The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring the group has access to a broad range of perspectives, including a focus on the health impacts of air pollution. Both the BHF and Professor Gemmell will provide valuable advice and support as we work together to fight air pollution and the damaging impact it has on our health, and to have the best air quality in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>James Cant, Director of British Heart Foundation Scotland, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;British Heart Foundation Scotland supports the development of LEZs and therefore welcomed the publication of draft plans regarding an LEZ in Glasgow. BHF Scotland is committed to working with Scottish Government and Local Authorities to tackle poor air quality. Now it is time for all stakeholders to come together to implement workable and effective solutions.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

              <p>Increasing family incomes and reducing living costs will be prioritised through the Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan.</p>
              <p>Actions include plans to develop a new income supplement, which would provide financial support to families who need it most. A new &pound;12 million employment support fund will help parents in work progress their careers and support unemployed parents into work.</p>
              <p>Other initiatives include a new national entitlement for the School Clothing Grant, to help with the costs of uniforms and sports kits, and new support for after-school and holiday childcare, helping parents work more flexibly and increase their incomes.</p>
              <p>The delivery plan is a key feature of the Child Poverty Act and will be backed by a range of investment, including a &pound;50 million Tackling Child Poverty Fund.</p>
              <p>Communities Secretary Angela Constance said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In a country as prosperous as Scotland no child should have their chances limited by poverty. These actions are the next step in meeting our ambitious child poverty targets designed to give every child every chance, and tackle deep-seated generational poverty.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Under UK Government cuts, money being is taken from the pockets of low income families, pushing them into crisis, debt, and poverty, with our public services and emergency aid responding as best they can. Further cuts will continue to hurt families, children, and even entire communities &ndash; instead, we want to invest in everyone&rsquo;s future.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;That is why we will take action to increase household incomes and reduce costs, supporting children and families here and now. And we will tackle the longer term impacts of poverty, and improve life chances &ndash; ensuring that children living in poverty now never have to be parents of children in poverty.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We know that this is not an issue that can be solved by one policy or portfolio &ndash; our plan will be taken forward right across government. Collectively, we will tackle child poverty and ensure the very best outcomes for children today, and generations to come.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>A total of 11 community events spanning nine local authorities are receiving support of more than &pound;48,000 in 2018 from the Scottish Clan Event Fund.</p>
              <p>The fund supports events that engage local communities and encourage international visitors. For the sixteen events funded last year, receiving &pound;47,550, VisitScotland estimate 60% of those attending were international visitors and the net economic impact of the events was in excess of &pound;1.7 million.</p>
              <p>The 2018 grants include &pound;5,000 to the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, for a commemoration event planned on 15 September.</p>
              <p>As she met representatives of the Heritage Trust, Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop confirmed the Clan Fund would support further events in 2019 and 2020 through the next funding round, to open to applications at the end of May.</p>
              <p>Ms Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s rich history is a huge draw for visitors from around the world. And with up to 50 million people globally claiming Scottish ancestry, we know that our cultural heritage is one of our unique selling points as a &lsquo;must visit&rsquo; destination.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Clan Event Fund is about tapping into that market and &ndash; crucially &ndash; supporting clan organisations to connect with and involve people within their local communities.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Events are taking place this year the length and breadth of the country, from Orkney to Argyll. The plans in Prestonpans are significant as they demonstrate the expansion of community-focused activities into areas not traditionally associated with Scottish clans.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Paul Bush OBE, VisitScotland&rsquo;s Director of Events, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The 11 events receiving funding from the latest round of the Scottish Clan Event Fund are a wonderful addition to our vibrant portfolio of events and festivals in 2018.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland is the perfect stage for events and the Clan Event Fund plays an important role in delivering this by ensuring visitors looking to explore their ancestry and connect with Scotland&rsquo;s heritage are offered an authentic and engaging experience.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Arran Johnston, Executive Trustee of the Battle of Prestonpans (1745) Heritage Trust said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted to be working with the Scottish Clan Event Fund to hold a really engaging commemorative event to mark the first-ever memorial to those who fell at the Battle of Prestonpans.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;With this support we&rsquo;ll be able to put on an exciting and fitting event in September, taking the story of the clans and regiments of the '45 out into our community. The Clan Event Fund is helping us raise awareness among local audiences of their rich historical assets, as well as bringing visitors to East Lothian, which is crucial for economic development.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The 11 events supported in 2018, totaling &pound;48,050, are:</p>

              <p>New figures demonstrate renewable electricity generation in Scotland in 2017 increased by 26% on last year, and 14% on the previous record year in 2015, making 2017 a record year for renewable electricity generation and for the first time ever Scotland has more than 10GW of installed renewable capacity.</p>
              <p>The latest figures show that in 2017, it is estimated that the equivalent of 68.1% of gross electricity consumption came from renewable sources, up 14.1 percentage points from 54% in 2016. This is 45 percentage points more than the equivalent figure for the rest of the UK.</p>
              <p>The latest figures, published today also show:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>At the end of Q4 2017 a record, 10GW of installed renewables electricity capacity was operational in Scotland, a 13% increase over the year from Q4 2016</li>
              <li>In 2017, wind generation increased by 34% and hydro by 9%</li>
              <li>Renewable electricity generation in Q4 of 2017 in Scotland increased by 45% from the same time last year (Q4 2016)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse welcomed these figures saying:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These figures show that Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy sector is stronger than ever and has a strong pipeline of further projects still to be constructed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Despite damaging policy changes from the UK Government that will soon come into full effect, we continue to harness, galvanize and support Scotland&rsquo;s renewables potential, both in generation and infrastructure.</p>
              <p>"Scotland's Energy Strategy recognises and builds on our achievements to date and on our country's capacity for innovation. Renewable energy will play a hugely significant role in powering Scotland's future and through the strategy we want to ensure the correct strategic decisions are taken to support this much valued sector of Scotland&rsquo;s economy as it goes from strength to strength."</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-trends-section-6-renewables">View the report&nbsp;here</a>.</p>
              <p>In 2017, renewable electricity generation in Scotland was 24,826 GWh, up 26% from 19,676 GWh in 2016 and up 14% from 21,759 GWh in 2015, the previous record year. Installed capacity increased by 1149MW from Q4 2016 to reach 10,047MW by Q4 2017, again a record level of renewables capacity.</p>

              <p>The first contract to be awarded under Transport Scotland's&nbsp;framework agreement to dual the A9 was awarded to Perth-based civil engineering firm, I &amp; H Brown Limited, for demolition works on the Luncarty to Pass of Birnam Scheme.&nbsp; These works are scheduled to commence on site at the start of April.</p>
              <p>A further&nbsp; contract to carry out tree clearance along the route of the Luncarty to Birnam Scheme as part of the advance works programme, is planned to be awarded by Transport Scotland in May.</p>
              <p>Advance works, such as tree clearance, enable seasonal activities to be undertaken before the main construction contract is awarded, while ground investigation works undertaken at the early stages of a project can help inform the design process. Both these examples of advance works can help reduce the risk of delays to the construction programme, assisting the main contractor when appointed.</p>
              <p>Keith Brown, Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see a locally-based SME securing contracts for these preliminary works on the next section of the A9 Dualling Programme.&nbsp; We are working diligently towards our ambitious target of having dual-carriageway introduced to the A9 between Perth and Inverness by 2025.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Luncarty to Pass of Birnam project connects two existing sections of dual-carriageway and will make a significant difference to people&rsquo;s journeys when it&rsquo;s fully opened to traffic.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As each section of road is finished, we are opening up Scotland for trade and tourism, which is helping to strengthen our economy.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Ground investigations necessary to provide detailed information for the four companies tendering for the main construction contract are now complete and archaeological excavations are continuing on the 9.5km Luncarty to Pass of Birnam section.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>AOC Archaeology Group, which was awarded the &pound;500,000 contract in January, has completed its initial investigations and will continue to excavate key areas and document any finds over the coming months.</p>
              <p>The appointment of the construction contractor for Luncarty to Pass of Birnam is expected in the first half of 2018.</p>

              <p>Scotland's Chief Statistician today published the Scottish Government Urban Rural Classification 2016. This version updates the previous version (2013-2014) with the latest available settlement population figures and drive time estimates. The definitions of urban and rural areas underlying the classification are unchanged.</p>
              <p>Due to changes in postcode population densities Barrhead (East Renfrewshire) is now classed as a settlement in its own right in the 2016 Classification. Barrhead was part of the Greater Glasgow Settlement for the 2013‑2014 Classification. As a result Barrhead is now classed as an &lsquo;other urban&rsquo; settlement.</p>
              <p>Changes to settlement sizes have resulted in some changes in classification to some settlements:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The populations of Dalgety Bay (Fife), Forres (Moray) Kilsyth (North Lanarkshire) and Prestonpans (East Lothian) have risen above the 10,000 population threshold and are now classed as &lsquo;other urban&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;small towns&rsquo;.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Six settlements previously had population estimates below the 3,000 population threshold but have risen above the 3,000 threshold for the 2016 Classification and are now classed as &lsquo;small town&rsquo; as opposed to a &lsquo;rural area&rsquo;. The settlements are Blackburn (Aberdeenshire), Conon Bridge and Maryburgh (Highland), Garelochhead, (Argyll and Bute), Laurencekirk (Aberdeenshire), Leuchars and Guardbridge (Fife) and Winchburgh (West Lothian).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The full publication can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.gov.scot/ISBN/9781788516204">http://www.gov.scot/ISBN/9781788516204</a></p>
              <p>The publication includes background information, methodology and guidance on the use of the classification, and also the geographic information to allow analysts to use the classification in their research. The classification uses the Government&rsquo;s definition of rurality which defines settlements of 3,000 people or less to be rural. It also classifies areas as remote based on a drive time of 30 minutes or more from settlements of at least 10,000 people.</p>
              <p>There were no noticeable drive time boundary changes due to any new roads.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government Urban Rural Classification was last produced based on 2012 Settlements, and named the 2013-2014 Classification. This updated version is reflective of 2016 Settlements, and has been named the 2016 Scottish Government Urban Rural Classification. The change in name format to a single year &ndash; which refers to the date of the mid-year estimates on which the population statistics for the Settlements are based &ndash; was made in order to make it clearer in the title of the classification the date of the statistics used.</p>

              <p>With one year to go before the UK is due to leave the EU, the Scottish Government today set out its top priorities for the Brexit negotiations.</p>
              <p>Michael Russell, Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe, said Scotland had so far been excluded from the Brexit process by the UK Government but the voice of the people of Scotland must now be heard.</p>
              <p>The government has published a report, <em>Protecting What Matters &ndash; What&rsquo;s at stake for individuals in the Brexit talks</em>, which sets out the key issues people want answers to about Brexit and their future.</p>
              <p>Mr Russell said it is essential Single Market membership is put back on the table in order to resolve many of the concerns raised.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>He said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There is one year to go before Brexit but a little over six months until an exit deal must be signed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is clear that even at this late stage there is a fog of confusion and concern about what lies ahead. People and business have spent nearly two years without information on crucial issues that affects their future .</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In the report we are publishing today we set out the questions people have and, crucially,&nbsp; how they can be answered.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Throughout this process the UK Government has failed to answer legitimate concerns and questions about the impact on jobs, rights and protections,&nbsp; family life, public services. That is unacceptable and those concerns must be heard and acted upon.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;For the Scottish Government our top priorities in these negotiations are jobs, living standards and protecting the NHS.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;And it is clear from what many people have said to us that their priorities can only be met by remaining in the Single Market.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;A commitment to keep Scotland and the UK in the Single Market &ndash; the world&rsquo;s biggest marketplace which is eight times the size of the UK alone &ndash; would provide the clarity people desperately need.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;But the hard Brexit favoured by the UK Government will depress economic growth, cut tax revenues and make it harder to attract the doctors, nurses and other health workers we need.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The UK Government has so far failed to meet in any way its commitment that the Scottish Government and other devolved administrations should oversee the negotiations and that objectives should be agreed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;That must change. Scotland&rsquo;s voice must be heard and Scotland must stay in the Single Market.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0053/00533670.pdf">publication</a> is available on the Scottish Government website.</p>

              <p>Autistic people and their families will receive tailored information about all the local support available to them, under an updated national strategy.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government will work with partners to create a &lsquo;national post-diagnostic support toolbox&rsquo; that pulls information about local services into one place. It is in response to requests for better support during and after diagnosis, and for consistent, relevant and up-to-date information.</p>
              <p>The toolbox was announced in the updated Scottish Strategy for Autism, which outlines the priorities for the next three years. Other actions will include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>National awards celebrating the successes of autistic people as well as innovative and excellent care</li>
              <li>National awareness raising campaigns to increase understanding of autistic people&rsquo;s needs</li>
              <li>Support for health and social care staff and teachers to better understand autism</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Mental Health Minister Maureen Watt announced the developments at the National Autism Conference in Edinburgh, an event being held during World Autism Awareness Week.</p>
              <p>Ms Watt said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our updated plan builds on the work and progress we have made since the Scottish Government published the first strategy in 2011. Late last year we asked autistic people, their families and those working in support and care to tell us where we needed to go next. More than 1,200 people took the opportunity to share their experiences, concerns and hopes, and our updated strategy reflects this.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Autistic people and their families were clear they needed better and more easily-accessible information about support. And I want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to make the public and those who provide care and education are not just aware of the needs of autistic people, but their successes and contributions as well.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>COSLA&rsquo;s Health and Social Care Spokesperson, Councillor Peter Johnston, said:&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is great to see the launch of the new updated autism strategy, I wholeheartedly welcome it. I also very much welcome the partnership approach between ourselves and Scottish Government to get us to this stage.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is good to see autism getting pushed up the political agenda and I sincerely hope that this updated strategy further improves the general public&rsquo;s understanding of autism.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

              <p>There are estimated to be around 47,000 people with autism in Scotland.</p>

              <p>An additional &pound;200,000 will be invested to help reduce isolation and improve job opportunities through the teaching of digital skills.</p>
              <p>The Digital Participation Charter Fund has supported 143 organisations to help 15,000 vulnerable people gain basic digital skills since its launch in 2014.</p>
              <p>The fund supports the work of the Digital Participation Charter - a group of organisations which use their expertise to help people in the community, and their own workforce, to gain digital skills.</p>
              <p>Citizens Advice Scotland has today become the 500<sup>th</sup> signatory.</p>
              <p>Announcing the funding, Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop visited The Welcoming &ndash; a charity in Edinburgh that has used resources from the fund to equip refugees with digital skills.</p>
              <p>Ms Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government is committed to increasing digital participation and ensuring that everyone gets the opportunity to enjoy the social, cultural and economic benefits digital skills can bring.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our Digital Participation Charter Fund is a key part of that work. The funding I&rsquo;m announcing today will be focussed on reducing isolation and loneliness and helping people get back into the world of work.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I would like to thank all of the 500 organisations who have supported this work by signing up to the Digital Participation Charter &ndash; including our latest signatory, Citizens Advice Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Citizen&rsquo;s Advice Scotland Trustee, Karen Nailen said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Citizens Advice Bureau network can play an important role in supporting digital participation. We have a national reach: with almost 300 locations across Scotland, we help one in 14&nbsp;adults every year - 34% of whom have limited or no access to the internet.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We also have more than 3,000 staff and volunteers&nbsp;and we want to ensure those individuals have the skills and confidence to support clients to get online.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>David McNeill, Director of Digital at the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, which administers the Digital Participation Charter Fund, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Citizens Advice Scotland join an active community of organisations across the public, private and third sectors who are taking action to support the 800,000 people in Scotland who need help to make the most of new technology and the internet.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Charter Fund has also enabled community projects to assist over 15,000 people to improve their job prospects or reduce social isolation by developing basic digital skills. We are grateful for the continued support of the Scottish Government to increase digital participation, ensuring the benefits of the internet are available to everyone."</p>
              <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
              <p>Today&rsquo;s announcement marks the sixth round of Scottish Government funding to the Digital Participation Charter Fund.</p>
              <p>Organisations can bid for funds to:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Support working age people to increase financial independence and employment opportunities</li>
              <li>Reduce social isolation and loneliness through digital skills</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For information on how to apply, <a href="https://scvo.org.uk/digital/participation/charter-fund">visit the SCVO website</a>. The closing date is June 11.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>As the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) marks its fifth anniversary, Community Safety Minister Annabelle Ewing has praised the service for its life-saving work.</p>
              <p>Key milestones of the single service include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Responding to over 350,000 emergency incidents including more than 100,000 fires</li>
              <li>&pound;44.5 million invested in new fleet and &pound;17 million on new operational equipment</li>
              <li>&pound;52.7 million invested in new buildings and refurbishment, including North headquarters in Aberdeen and a control centre in Dundee</li>
              <li>100 new firefighters hired in 2017 plus recruitment drive for 300 more posts</li>
              <li>New water rescue units in Oban and Dumfries with teams increased from 15 to 20</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Ms Ewing marked the anniversary at a live water rescue demonstration by the SFRS at Falkirk&rsquo;s Helix Park. She said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Incidents like last week&rsquo;s major fire in Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow show the sheer bravery of fire teams willing to put themselves in danger to assist others. It is also important to recognise the service&rsquo;s valuable preventative work, which includes helping the most vulnerable and elderly members of the community stay safe in their own homes.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our priority is to protect the front line and the 2018-19 budget provides additional spending power of &pound;15.5 million to allow the SFRS to invest for service transformation, on top of a &pound;21.7 million increase in operational budget this year</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I would like to thank all our firefighters and support staff for their hard work and commitment in responding to the complex and challenging situations they face every day.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Alasdair Hay is the Chief Officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.</p>
              <p>He said: &ldquo;We have not only established a world-class emergency service &ndash; but the foundation to allow us to do so much more for Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;By protecting our frontline, ensuring equitable access to resources and equipment, and through our tireless prevention efforts we have ensured that Scotland&rsquo;s communities are safer than ever.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are committed to our vision of a more enhanced and resilient Service and by offering to transform, we continue to lead the way in the public sector. We will build on our solid foundations by investing in innovative technologies, and ensuring our firefighters are trained and equipped to protect Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The SFRS was created in in 2013 following the merger of Scotland's eight regional fire and rescue services. It is the largest in the UK and fourth largest in the world, with 356 fire stations, 422 pumping appliances and some 8,000 personnel.</p>
              <p>Between 2013/14 and 2016/17 the service responded to almost 350,000 emergency incidents including over 100,000 fires. In the same period SFRS conducted almost 335,000 home fire safety visits and installed over 270,000 smoke alarms.</p>

              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s population growth over the next ten years is projected to be predominantly in the central belt and urban areas, and mostly as a result of migration patterns, according to figures published today by National Records of Scotland.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Three quarters of local authority areas (24 councils) are expected to see growth, with the remainder projected to face depopulation over the next decade.</p>
              <p>The <strong>Population Projections for Scottish Areas</strong> are based on the latest mid-2016 population estimates and provide an indication of the future population size and age structure of Scottish areas based on a set of assumptions about future fertility, mortality and migration.</p>
              <p>Tim Ellis, the Registrar General for Scotland, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Migration is driving projected increases in population in most areas of Scotland over the next 10 years.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s population is also projected to age. Between 2016 and 2026, all council areas in Scotland are projected to experience an increase in their population aged 75 and over.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician today released Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD) Scotland 2016.</p>
              <p>The main findings are:</p>
              <p>GERD in Scotland was &pound;2,331 million in 2016. In real terms this represents an increase of &pound;50 million or 2.2 per cent since 2015, taking GERD spend to its highest level since the series began in 2001.</p>
              <p>Most of the growth in Scotland&rsquo;s GERD over the latest year came from the business sector.</p>
              <p>Business Enterprise R&amp;D (BERD) spend was &pound;1,072 million in Scotland in 2016 - up 10 per cent in real terms between 2015 and 2016.</p>
              <p>Higher Education R&amp;D (HERD) spend was &pound;1,061 million in Scotland in 2016 - down 4.9 per cent in real terms between 2015 and 2016.</p>
              <p>In 2016, R&amp;D spending in the business sector overtook that of higher education - this is the first time in the series (back to 2001) that BERD spend has exceeded HERD spend in Scotland.</p>
              <p>In 2016, Scotland&rsquo;s GERD was 1.54 per cent of GDP, compared to 1.94 per cent for the EU. The gap in 2016 was 0.40 percentage points, which is 0.04 percentage points narrower than in 2015.</p>
              <p>The figures released today were produced in accordance with professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>

              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s public services watchdog has said &lsquo;good early progress&rsquo; has been made in setting up the country&rsquo;s new social security service.</p>
              <p>Audit Scotland&rsquo;s report highlights that establishment of the new agency &ndash; Social Security Scotland &ndash; and delivery of the first benefits are on track.</p>
              <p>Audit Scotland indicates that Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have a major role to play in the transfer of the 11 newly devolved benefits.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government is calling for the DWP to confirm its detailed plans for the safe and secure transfer of these benefits and to demonstrate that the DWP can match the Scottish Government&rsquo;s pace.</p>
              <p>Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is the most significant transfer of powers since devolution and I am pleased Audit Scotland recognises the progress we have made so far in building this new public service.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are confident that we are on track against our plans. However, as highlighted by Audit Scotland, it is crucial that we have clarity and confirmation &ndash; and that we understand what the DWP&rsquo;s detailed plans are. We cannot deliver this in isolation and we need to know that the DWP is able to match our pace.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have followed Audit Scotland recommendations from previous reports on major programmes. We recognise the significant amount of work still to be done as we continue the programme to transfer powers, bring forward legislation and build the infrastructure we need. We are confident that we have robust plans in place and a full understanding of our overarching costs and are on track to deliver benefits to Scotland&rsquo;s people. &rdquo;</p>

              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s first fully devolved employment service will start delivering flexible and tailored support from Tuesday 3 April.</p>
              <p>Fair Start Scotland will offer personalised support for at least 38,000 people further removed from the labour market.</p>
              <p>Ahead of the launch, the Scottish Government set out the next steps towards delivering more effective and joined-up employability support across Scotland.</p>
              <p>&lsquo;No One Left Behind &ndash; Next Steps for the Integration and Alignment of Employability Support in Scotland&rsquo; outlines measures to join up employability support across Scotland, including working with the Scottish Prison Service to develop new routes into employment, and piloting a Single Health and Work Gateway in Fife and Dundee.</p>
              <p>Speaking at a visit to Capital City Partnership&rsquo;s Joined Up for Jobs Integration Project, Employability Minister Jamie Hepburn said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The launch of Fair Start Scotland is a landmark moment in our journey to deliver a person-centred employment service.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our new powers have created a service that is more flexible and responsive to a changing labour market; one that will tackle inequalities and grow Scotland&rsquo;s economy by helping more people into work. It is also fairer - the fact the service is voluntary means people are not driven to take part through fear of sanctions.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are aware that this is only the start - our clear focus on joining up employability with health, justice and housing, ensures a solid platform on which we will build in the future.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Over &pound;200 million of debt has been repaid since the reform of the Debt Arrangement Scheme in 2011, Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy Paul Wheelhouse has announced.</p>
              <p>More than 6,000 people have now completed a debt payment plan through the scheme.</p>
              <p>Mr Wheelhouse <a href="https://www.aib.gov.uk/debt-arrangement-scheme-das-way-forward">also announced a raft of improvements to DAS </a>which seek to make the scheme even more of an appealing product to those in Scotland struggling with problem debt.</p>
              <p>DAS was launched by the Scottish Government in 2004 and is administered by Accountant in Bankruptcy. Since the process was reformed in 2011 to widen access to the scheme, over &pound;200 million has been repaid through DAS.</p>
              <p>The Minister said: &ldquo;The Debt Arrangement Scheme is currently the only statutory debt management plan in the UK and has proven to be a valuable tool for helping people suffering from unsustainable debt back onto their feet.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is a testament to the remarkable success of DAS that the UK Government is looking to introduce a scheme which freezes interest rates and charges on debts and gives debtors much-needed breathing space across the whole of the UK, very much modelled on DAS.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This demonstrates that Scotland continues to lead the way when it comes to issues of personal debt management and debt relief.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Over &pound;200 million has now been repaid through DAS since the new regulations opening the scheme up to more people who need help were seven years ago.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;But we refuse to take the success of DAS for granted, which is why we&rsquo;re introducing changes to exclude housing debts from debt payment plans should debtors wish, and remove the requirement for debtors to contribute every penny of their surplus income.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;These changes make DAS more flexible, helping encourage more people to consider the scheme as a viable method for bringing their finances back under control and one that creditors can have confidence in.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>From 1 July 2011 to 27 March 2018, the amount repaid through DAS has reached over &pound;200,700,000.</p>
              <p>Debt charity StepChange is helping around 2500 people in Scotland repay their debts through DAS.</p>
              <p>Head of StepChange Scotland Sharon Bell said: &ldquo;We welcome the announcements today. Scotland is pioneering responsible debt repayment programmes that give people with problem debt a fair chance to repay.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Debt Arrangement Scheme offers our clients an opportunity to regain control of their finances and provides breathing space protections from unfair charges, harassment or repossession, which lead the way in the UK.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Every pound repaid represents a burden lifted from the shoulders of those who are responsibly trying to repay their debts and make ends meet.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;2017 saw nearly 20,000 people in Scotland contact StepChange for help, the vast majority as a result of life events such as illness or unemployment they could not have expected or planned for.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Anybody can get into difficulty. I urge people to seek help, rather than struggling on alone.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>AiB carried out two consultations into DAS during 2016 and 2017 to review the changes to the legislation made in 2013 and 2014.</p>
              <p>Responses to these consultations broadly agreed the changes introduced in recent years had met their intended outcomes. However, some industry respondents also recommended a number of improvements.</p>
              <p>Feedback suggested that the compulsory inclusion of mortgage and rent arrears could result in debtors facing difficulties in their housing situations and proposed debtors should be able to exclude these debts if they so wish.</p>
              <p>The consultations also highlighted the requirement for all surplus income to be included in a debt payment programme be removed.</p>
              <p>In future, to strike the right balance of fairness to both creditors and debtors, debtors will be able to choose the level of payment they offer to the scheme and creditors will be able to consider this sum when choosing to accept or reject the proposal.</p>

              <p>Families of young children may be entitled to extra financial support, under Scottish Government plans.</p>
              <p>Worth up to a total of &pound;1100, Best Start Grant will be one of 11 benefits to be paid as part of the new Scottish social security system.</p>
              <p>It will replace the UK Government Sure Start Maternity Grant in Scotland, offering low income families a &pound;600 birth payment when they have their first child and two new payments per child of &pound;250 when the child can access a nursery place and when he or she starts primary school.</p>
              <p>In a further significant improvement to current UK arrangements, support will be reintroduced for the second and all subsequent children of a &pound;300 birth payment per child together with the two later payments of &pound;250 each.</p>
              <p>A 12-week consultation on how the scheme will operate is now open.</p>
              <p>Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our new Best Start Grant will be a significant help to those families who need it most, increasing current UK Government support from &pound;500 to &pound;1100 for the first child and from zero to &pound;800 for the second and all subsequent children. This support will help pay for the essential expenses that come with having a new baby and then again at two other milestones before the child starts school.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is a significant investment in families and children and we are making it because we know how important it is for children to have the best start in life. This new grant will be one of the first we will deliver in our new Scottish social security system.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are building a new public service for Scotland that will treat people with dignity and respect. This consultation is an important part of that work and I am keen to hear from as many organisations and people as possible.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician today published Drugs Seizures and Offender Characteristics, 2016-17. The publication provides information on drug seizures made by the police in Scotland and the characteristics of those found in possession of drugs.</p>
              <p>The quantity of drugs seized can fluctuate considerably each year and does not necessarily move in line with the number of seizures made. Whilst most drug seizures consist of relatively small quantities (usually possession-related crimes), annual quantities of drugs seized can be greatly influenced by a small number of large seizures (usually from supply-related crimes).</p>
              <p>For crimes of drug supply, the main Class A drugs seized by Police Scotland in 2016-17 were heroin (54.1 kilograms), cocaine (120.3 kilograms) and crack cocaine (5.2 kilograms). In addition Police Scotland also seized 8,600 ecstasy-type tablets.</p>
              <p>Again for crimes of drug supply, the main Class B drugs seized by Police Scotland in 2016-17 were herbal cannabis (347.9 kilograms) and cannabis resin (322.1 kilograms). They also seized over 18,000 cannabis plants. For Class C drugs, the main drug seized was diazepam or other benzodiazepines (approximately 2.2 million tablets).</p>
              <p>A sample of drug possession crime for 2016-17 estimated that 60% of drug possession crimes involved herbal cannabis or cannabis resin, with 10% each for cocaine and diazepam.</p>
              <p>Over 2014-15 to 2016-17, the vast majority of drug possession offenders were male (86%). The median age of an offender was 29 years old, with almost two thirds (65%) being between 20 and 39 years old.</p>

              <p>Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has welcomed National Statistics confirming that crime in Scotland has fallen by around a third in just under a decade while more people than ever feel safe in their neighbourhood.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Crime and Justice Survey 2016-17, based on interviews with almost 5,600 adults about their experience of crime, whether or not reported to police, estimates there were around 712,000 crimes &ndash; 32% fewer than in 2008-09 &ndash; while property crime is down 34% and violence down 27% over the same period.</p>
              <p>Mr Matheson pledged continued government investment in crime prevention measures and new violence research, as the Survey highlighted that a very small minority of adults continue to experience &lsquo;repeat victimisation&rsquo; both from property crime and violent crime.</p>
              <p>While the vast majority of adults (97.1%) were not victims of violent crime last year, 1.1% of adults suffered violence more than once (&lsquo;repeat victims&rsquo;) accounting for two-thirds of these crimes, and 0.3% of adults experienced five or more violent crimes, experiencing over a quarter (28%) of all such incidents.</p>
              <p>Mr Matheson said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s firm focus on prevention, responsive policing and local partnerships to help individuals and communities keep themselves safe has had a positive impact on long-term crime trends and people&rsquo;s feeling of safety, with recorded crime at a 43-year low.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;While this progress is cause for encouragement, it will never be an excuse for complacency. As well as continued government investment in policing and funding partners such as Neighbourhood Watch Scotland, Crimestoppers and the Scottish Violence Reduction Unit, I have commissioned further research into those areas where violence persists.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;A better understanding of the nature and circumstances of violence can help improve how not only the justice system, but wider public services pre-empt and respond to the issue. We must keep identifying those areas where we can most effectively focus our collective efforts to achieve the greatest impact, ensuring all our communities benefit from falling crime.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Among the 2016-17 Survey&rsquo;s other findings:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Most adults in Scotland (77%) said they felt very or fairly safe walking alone in their local area after dark &ndash; the highest level ever measured by the SCJS &ndash; up from 74% two years before, and 66% in 2008-09</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Just over two-thirds (68%) of crime was property-related, while a third was violent crime &ndash; of which 72% were cases of minor assault resulting in no or negligible injury</li>
              <li>Most adults (86.6%) experienced no crime &ndash; with the proportion of Scots experiencing crime last year fewer than one-in-seven &ndash; down from around one-in-five in 2008-09</li>
              <li>11.5% of adults were estimated to have been a victim of property crime and 2.9% of adults a victim of violent crime in the previous year</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>The likelihood of being a victim of any crime was higher among younger adults (aged 16-24), those living in the most deprived areas and adults living in urban areas. This pattern was also found across both property and violent crime categories</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>The proportion of younger adults experiencing violent crime has more than halved from 12% in 2008-09 to 5.3% in 2016-17, although they remain the age group most likely to have been victims of violence</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>Most adults (58%) said the police were doing a good or excellent job in their local area, while public confidence across all six policing measures asked about in the survey is higher than in 2008-09, with two (ability to solve crime, and to catch criminals) up from 2014-15, and the remainder at the same levels as two years before</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2018/03/9068">Read the National Statistics bulletin &lsquo;Scottish Crime and Justice Survey 2016/17: Main Findings bulletin</a>.</p>
              <p>The Justice Secretary has commissioned a detailed serious crime study, involving Scottish Government and Police Scotland analysts examining a large sample of crime records. &nbsp;The review will focus on cases of attempted murder, serious assault and robbery &ndash; crimes which account for nearly four in five non-sexual violent crimes recorded by police.</p>
              <p>The project will involve the review of two-thousand cases by analysts from both Scottish Government and Police Scotland, drawn from 2008-09 and 2017-18. It will examine the characteristics of victims and offenders, including their relationships, as well as the settings for these crimes, the injuries sustained and the role of weapons, alcohol or drugs. Reporting alongside the next annual Police Recorded Crime statistics towards the end of the year, the objective of the research &lsquo;deep dive&rsquo; is to ensure that government, police, local authorities and other agencies have more detailed insight on where best to target resources.</p>

              <p>Two per cent of children in Scotland were being looked after by local authorities or on the child protection register on July 31 2017, according to the latest Children&rsquo;s Social Work Statistics published today by Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician.</p>
              <p>The statistics which include information on children who were looked after, on the child protection register, or in secure care accommodation show that:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>14,897 children were looked after in 2017, a decrease of three per cent from 2016, and the fifth consecutive year of decline</li>
              <li>Foster care remains the most common accommodation for looked after children, accounting for over a third of looked after children (36%), whereas residential care accounts for 10% of looked after children.</li>
              <li>The number of adoptions of looked after children has generally increased since 2005, and 9 per cent of children (367) leaving care were adopted in 2017, which is the highest recorded level.</li>
              <li>Permanence Orders have increased every year since 2012, and now stand at 2050, a 6% increase on 2016.</li>
              <li>2,631 children were on the child protection register at the end of July 2017. This is a decrease of three per cent since 2016, and the third consecutive year of decrease.</li>
              <li>Since 2013 there has been a large increase in the number of children leaving the child protection register that had been registered for more than two years, and they increased from 255 to 282 between 2016 and 2017.</li>
              <li>80 young people were in secure care accommodation at the end of July 2017. The average number of young people placed in secure care accommodation during 2016-17 was 76, down from 85 during the previous year. If placements from the rest of the UK are excluded, the average number of young people from Scotland placed into secure care fell by 29% compared to last year.</li>

              <p>Most adults did not experience crime in 2016/17. The overall level of crime in Scotland and the likelihood of being a victim have both fallen since 2008/09, however no change was detected from 2014/15.</p>
              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician today released the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey (SCJS) 2016-17: Main Findings. The figures show that:</p>
              <p><strong>The extent and prevalence of crime in Scotland in 2016/17 </strong></p>
              <p>There were an estimated 712,000 crimes in 2016/17, down by around a third (32 per cent) since the 1,045,000 crimes estimated in 2008/09. No change has been detected since 2014/15 &ndash; the apparent increase from 688,000 incidents in 2014/15 is not statistically significant.</p>
              <p>Just over two-thirds of crime (68 per cent) was property-related. As in previous years, incidents of vandalism accounted for the largest proportion of property crime incidents (34 per cent), followed by other household theft (including bicycle theft) (27 per cent) and personal theft (26 per cent). The remainder were incidents of motor vehicle related theft (8 per cent) and housebreaking (5 per cent).</p>
              <p>Around a third of all crime was violent crime. Consistent with previous SCJS findings, the majority of violent crime incidents in 2016/17 were cases of minor assault resulting in no or negligible injury (72 per cent). Other violent crimes comprised minor assault with injury (13 per cent), serious assault (7 per cent), attempted assault (4 per cent) and robbery (3 per cent).</p>
              <p>Most adults (86.6 per cent) experienced no crime in 2016/17. The SCJS estimates that the proportion of adults experiencing crime has fallen from around one in five in 2008/09 (20.4 per cent), to fewer than one in seven in 2016/17 (13.4 per cent). The SCJS detected no statistically significant change in the likelihood of being a victim of crime between 2014/15 and 2016/17. In 2016/17, 11.5 per cent of adults were estimated to have been a victim of property crime and 2.9 per cent of adults a victim of violent crime.</p>
              <p>Around one-in-eleven adults (9.2 per cent) experienced one crime in 2016/17, while 4.3 per cent of adults were the victim of multiple crimes, experiencing just over three fifths of all SCJS crime (61 per cent). 3.3 per cent of adults were repeat victims (of two or more) of property crimes, while 1.1 per cent of adults were repeat victims of violent crimes. These repeat victims of violence are estimated to have experienced two-thirds of all violent crime in 2016/17.</p>
              <p>The likelihood of being a victim of any crime in 2016/17 was higher amongst younger adults (aged 16-24), those living in the most deprived areas and adults living in urban areas. This pattern was also found across both property and violent crime categories.</p>
              <p>When we look at violent crime:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The proportion of adults aged 16-24 experiencing violent crime has more than halved from 12.0 per cent in 2008/09 to 5.3 per cent in 2016/17, however they remained the age group most likely to have been victims of violence in 2016/17.</li>
              <li>The violent crime victimisation rate in 2016/17, for adults living in the 15 per cent most deprived areas (4.8%), had not shown any significant change from 2008/09, whereas the rate has reduced for those living in the rest of Scotland (from 3.8 per cent to 2.5 per cent).</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong><strong>Public Perceptions of Crime, the Police and the Justice System</strong></strong></p>
              <p>The majority of adults, 58 per cent, said that the police were doing a good or excellent job in their local area, similar to 2014/15 but this had decreased from 61 per cent in 2012/13.</p>
              <p>The majority of adults were also very or fairly confident in their local police force across the six measures of confidence asked about in this survey. Whilst generally the majority of adults in all population sub-groups were also confident in the police, the level of confidence was lower on some measures amongst victims of crime, those living in deprived areas and those in rural locations.</p>
              <p>Generally the public were fairly confident about the operation of the justice system across a range of measures, for example, 78 per cent were confident that it allows those accused of crimes to get a fair trial regardless of who they are and 75 per cent were confident that it makes sure everyone has access to the justice system if they need it. However, adults were less confident on other measures, for example, 39 per cent were confident that it gives punishments which fit the crime.</p>
              <p>Three quarters of respondents thought that the local crime rate had stayed the same or reduced (76 per cent), unchanged from 2014/15, but up from 65 per cent in 2006. More than three-quarters also said they felt very or fairly safe walking alone in their neighbourhood after dark (77 per cent), up from 74 per cent in 2014/15 and 66 per cent in 2008/09.</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The figures released today were produced in accordance with professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2018/03/9068">Read the full statistical publication</a>.</p>
              <p>This report covers interviews collected between April 2016 to May 2017.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Crime and Justice Survey is one of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s flagship national surveys delivering robust evidence for the &ldquo;Safer and Stronger&rdquo; Strategic Objective. The survey allows the people of Scotland to independently report their experiences and perceptions of crime, and thus influence the continued development and improvement of the Scottish Justice system.</p>
              <p>The publication presents statistics on the level of crime in Scotland, importantly including crime that is not reported to the police, but is limited to crimes against adults resident in households, and also does not cover all crime types. Police recorded crime is a measure of those crimes reported to the police and recorded by them as a crime or offence.</p>
              <p>The SCJS also provides a range of additional information, including details of adults&rsquo; perception of crime, the characteristics of crime, on victims, offenders, policing and the justice system.</p>
              <p>As with all surveys, SCJS results are always estimates, not precise figures. Results are only described as &lsquo;increases&rsquo; or &lsquo;decreases&rsquo; where statistical tests identify statistically significant differences. Where they do not detect significant change, results are reported as showing &lsquo;no change&rsquo;- even if the estimate from one year appears greater or smaller than the comparator year. Importantly, this does not mean there has definitely been no change, but that the sample is not large enough to confidently detect any change that has or has not occurred. These issues are common to all population surveys, particularly on issues that affect only a minority of people. Often, where changes and trends emerge, they can be more easily detected over longer time periods, as cumulative changes build year-on-year.</p>
              <p>The SCJS is the data source for two National Indicators for <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Performance/scotPerforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scotland's National Performance Framework</a> - <em>crime victimisation rate</em> and <em>public perception of general crime rate in local area</em>.</p>

              <p>Independent analysis due to be published alongside the Scottish Government&rsquo;s first Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan shows the extent of damage caused by UK Government welfare cuts.</p>
              <p>The analysis outlines projections of child poverty rates in Scotland on the basis of announced tax and benefit changes, and the consequent increases in poverty levels.</p>
              <p>It estimates that by 2030/31, 38% of children will be in relative poverty, 32% in absolute poverty, 17% in combined low income and material deprivation, and 16% of children will be in persistent poverty &ndash; all up significantly on current rates.</p>
              <p>Communities Secretary Angela Constance said:</p>
              <p>"This reveals the long-term damage of UK Government welfare cuts and austerity, with alarming increases across every measure of child poverty. We know the damage that has been caused already, but what alarms me is that the worst is still to come, with &pound;4 billion annual cuts by the end of this decade set to take a stark toll on families and children.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Addressing inequalities is core to everything we do to make Scotland fairer and more equal. That includes spending over &pound;100 million every year to protect people from the worst impact of UK Government welfare cuts &ndash; money that could be better spent on preventing poverty.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our Child Poverty Act recently established Scotland as the only part of the UK with statutory targets to tackle child poverty &ndash; and it is now more evident the scale of the challenge we face in meeting our ambitions due to UK Government policies.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The UK Government must urgently and drastically change course. If they won&rsquo;t, then they must deliver the necessary powers and financial levers to Scotland so we can do things differently and actually lift people out of poverty as opposed to only being able to mitigate the UK Government&rsquo;s cuts.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>An analysis document is attached, outlining the projected rises in child poverty.</p>
              <p>The Tackling Poverty Delivery Plan will publish later this week and is a key feature of the Child Poverty (Scotland) Act. The actions that will be set out in the plan will be supported through a range of investment, including a &pound;50 million Tackling Child Poverty Fund.</p>

              <p>Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing has written to the UK Government expressing his concerns over transitional arrangements for fisheries following Brexit and raising questions over the UK Government&rsquo;s approach to fisheries in the upcoming negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU.</p>
              <p>Mr Ewing has asked the UK Government for &lsquo;firm proposals&rsquo; on the nature of the consultation taking place between them and the EU ahead of the upcoming negotiations and assurances in relation to future negotiations, the protection of the fishing industry and Scotland&rsquo;s voice in future fishing negotiations.</p>
              <p>Full text of the letter below.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Dear Mr Gove,</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Further to the announcement on 19 March that the UK Government and the EU have reached a provisional agreement on the transitional arrangements that will apply after the UK leaves the EU, I wish to place on record my very serious objections to the impact the deal will have on Scottish fisheries.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government, in line with the overwhelming majority of people in Scotland, supports continued EU membership. Short of that position, retaining our place in the Single Market and Customs Union is essential. We have also been clear, that if the UK is to leave the EU, there must be a transition agreement in order to provide certainty for business and communities.</p>
              <p>We have consistently pressed for pragmatic arrangements to be found during the transition to ensure Scotland&rsquo;s continued participation in specific EU decisions, such as the fixing of annual fishing quotas.</p>
              <p>However, as I made clear in the Scottish Parliament earlier this week, the deal that the UK Government has provisionally made is the worst possible outcome for Scottish fisheries; one that means we will still be in the Common Fisheries Policy but not allowed to be a partner at the table &ndash; and therefore robbed of the means to protect our interests.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the deal the UK Government has made would appear to render our negotiating position weaker than ever &ndash; to the extent that neither the UK nor Scotland will be attending fisheries negotiations as a matter of right. The Scottish fishing industry, whose jobs, businesses and livelihoods are at stake, are rightly seeking clarification as to how this deal can be in their interests.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>In announcing the agreement reached with the EU, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU was keen to highlight the requirement for the EU to &ldquo;consult&rdquo; the UK ahead of negotiations.</p>
              <p>Mr Davis may place great faith in that &ldquo;concession&rdquo; but I remain deeply concerned that, even where consultation is undertaken in good faith, Scottish and UK fishing interests will be overridden where it is in the EU&rsquo;s interest to do so without our presence in the negotiations themselves. I do not regard such a critical loss of influence over such a vital national interest, and the resultant democratic deficit, as a positive outcome for Scottish fisheries, and neither does the Scottish fishing industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Neither David Davis, yourself or the Prime Minister have provided any substantial information on the nature of this consultation. As a matter of urgency I request that you provide the Scottish Government and Scotland&rsquo;s fishing industry with details on the form this consultation will take. I will be meeting George Eustice on Monday to discuss EU exit matters, including fisheries, and would ask that firm proposals are presented by the UK Government at that meeting on how it will include the Scottish Government in this consultative process.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The lack of priority given to fisheries by the UK Government in the transition negotiations raises huge concerns ahead of the upcoming negotiations on the future relationship with the EU. Ahead of that negotiation beginning I seek a number of clear guarantees for the benefit of Scotland&rsquo;s fishing industry.</p>
              <p>Firstly, that permanent access to Scottish waters and quota shares will not be used to secure other UK interests as part of this, or any future deal, with the EU.</p>
              <p>Secondly, that provision has been made that whilst the UK will no longer be a member state that the EU have confirmed that international quota swapping mechanisms will remain in place as they currently are. As a net importer of quota, Scotland&rsquo;s fishing fleets would face dire consequences around their very viability if this provision is not available for use.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Thirdly, in view of the significant interests that are at stake for Scotland, no negotiations with the EU should be undertaken on fisheries without seeking comprehensive input from the Scottish Government. I am aware David Lidington is to bring proposals on how the UK Government intends to include devolved administrations in the negotiations on the future relationship at the next meeting of the JMC(EN.)&nbsp; The importance of fisheries to Scotland cannot be understated in those negotiations.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, that in taking forward negotiations on the future relationship there will be an explicit recognition that in future annual fisheries negotiations the Scottish Government must be given as a minimum an equal or lead role where Scottish interests are at stake, to ensure that the rights and needs of its fishermen are protected. It would be a further outrage should the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU result in any diminution of the direct representation of Scottish interests by the Scottish Government in the annual negotiation process.</p>
              <p>I very much look forward to hearing your prompt response to the matters raised in this letter.</p>
              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing</strong></p>

              <p>Nine projects will receive &pound;515,000 for anti-sectarianism work &ndash; building on the &lsquo;unprecedented&rsquo; investment in this area by the Scottish Government in recent years, Annabelle Ewing has announced.</p>
              <p>The Minister for Community Safety &amp; Legal Affairs said the new funding will help reduce and prevent sectarianism in communities by delivering education in schools and workplaces, including:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Teacher and youth work training</li>
              <li>Engagement with online communities</li>
              <li>A school pupil exchange programme to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Corrymeela community</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The new initiatives build on previous Scottish Government investment - which to date has supported 108 organisations to deliver anti-sectarian education - and bring total funding for this work to &pound;13.5 million in the past six years.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>&nbsp;Read more from some of the recipient organisations on the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/justice-safety/?p=1616&amp;preview=true">Justice &amp; Safety blog</a>.</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Meanwhile, acting on recommendations of the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Justice Committee, the Minister has confirmed that Professor Duncan Morrow will chair an independent working group to look at the scope for establishing a legal definition of &lsquo;sectarianism&rsquo; in Scots Law - potentially making it easier for police and prosecutors to tackle the issue.</p>
              <p>Ms Ewing commented:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Sectarianism must be tackled with the same conviction as every other hate crime. Since 2012 we have delivered an unprecedented range of activities to tackle the issue across Scotland, which have made a significant impact &ndash; and this latest funding builds on these achievements.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have shown sustained leadership and commitment to this agenda and look forward to working with others who can positively influence the communities they serve so that we can eradicate sectarianism once and for all.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I thank Professor Morrow for taking forward the important work to consider the legal definition of sectarianism and I look forward to the working group&rsquo;s recommendations.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Prof Duncan Morrow said:</p>
              <p>"The continuing government support for community-based projects is evidence of genuine commitment to tackle sectarian issues where they matter-in real lives.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>"I look forward now to taking this opportunity to explore the options for improving the legal basis for protecting against sectarianism."</p>

              <p>Certainty is urgently required on the UK&rsquo;s future participation in EU research programmes after Brexit, Higher Education and Science Minister Shirley-Anne Somerville has said.</p>
              <p>Speaking ahead of a visit to Brussels on Monday, Ms Somerville called on the UK Government to make an early signed deal with the EU on science and innovation a priority.</p>
              <p>It comes as figures show Scottish organisations have secured over &euro;468 million to date through the current EU research and innovation programme, Horizon 2020.</p>
              <p>The programme has facilitated a significant number of international research and innovation collaborations with Scotland since its start in 2014, including the EPAD project which is working to understand and prevent Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
              <p>The minister said that the continuing lack of certainty surrounding Scotland&rsquo;s future involvement in the current Horizon 2020 programme and its replacement, FP9, is already hampering Scottish universities&rsquo; ability to attract research investment and staff.</p>
              <p>Ms Somerville said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scottish universities are renowned for their excellence in research and innovation, outperforming the rest of the UK in areas such as agriculture, chemistry and biological sciences.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;In addition EU nationals make a significant contribution to our research and innovation community and it is vital that we can continue to host the brightest and the best from Europe at our world-leading universities.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our institutions and their staff need the clarity now to protect Scotland&rsquo;s world-class reputation for research and innovation. We place great value on our partnerships across the EU and want to see these continue.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is essential that the UK Government prioritises science and innovation in the on-going negotiations with the EU and I urge them to provide more detail of how they intend the UK to collaborate in future EU research programmes.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal of the University of Glasgow, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our overriding priority has to be securing the closest possible relationship with our European partners post-Brexit &ndash; ensuring access to European funding to continue the world-leading research undertaken at our universities.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;But just as important as funding is people, and it is absolutely vital for the future success of Scotland&rsquo;s higher education sector that our access to key European networks is not hindered in the years to come.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The ability of researchers at Scottish universities to work closely with colleagues in their fields from across Europe will be vital in ensuring Scotland maintains our position as a world-leader on key research areas &ndash; delivering economic growth, creating jobs and contributing to social progress.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our higher education sector and our research in particular is a clear success story for Scotland &ndash; and it is essential that this is prioritised in the Brexit negotiations.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>In Brussels the Minister will highlight the Scottish Government's recent <a href="https://www.scotlandeuropa.com/scotland-europa-special-paper-scotlands-position-paper-on-the-9th-framework-programme-for-research-and-innovation/">response to the EU&rsquo;s FP9 consultation</a>. The Minister will speak at a reception which will include an audience of academics, representatives from Member States governments, Commission representatives, Members of the European Parliament and NGOs with a research and innovation interest.</p>
              <p>The Minister will be accompanied by the Chief Scientific Adviser for Scotland, Professor Sheila Rowan, the Principal of Glasgow University, Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli and the Principal of the University of Edinburgh, Professor Peter Mathieson.</p>

              <p>The outcome of this week&rsquo;s EU talks demonstrates why the UK Government must urgently reverse its decision to shut Scotland out of the negotiations Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe Michael Russell, has said.</p>
              <p>Mr Russell said that for Scotland, Brexit could now be even worse than first feared - with jobs, trade, living standards and vital national interests all at risk.</p>
              <p>He said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This week has shown that Scotland is not being treated as an equal partner.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;For the next phase of talks Scottish interests must not be swept aside as they have been so far. The Scottish Government must play a meaningful part in the UK&rsquo;s negotiating position.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The EU guidelines for the next phase of talks show precisely why remaining within the Single Market &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most valuable market-place and around eight times the size of the UK &ndash; must be put back on the table.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Because of the UK Government&rsquo;s own hard Brexit red lines the EU have today made it absolutely clear they will only offer a basic trade deal which we know could cost each person in Scotland &pound;1,600 a year compared with EU membership.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;And today they have said even that will be dependent on maintaining current rules for the fishing industry.&nbsp; Is it all pain for no gain. The Scottish fishing industry is facing a massive sell-out because of the total failure by the UK to keep its promises to them.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The UK Government has agreed to a back-stop arrangement on Northern Ireland, and the only option that is currently on the table would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the Single Market for goods and&nbsp; the Customs Union even if the rest of the UK leaves.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We fully recognise the unique circumstances there, but Scotland cannot be left at a competitive disadvantage &ndash; and if it is possible for one part of the UK to effectively remain in the Single Market and Customs Union then it must be possible for others too. We have produced detailed proposals to keep Scotland in the Single Market and they must now be taken seriously.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The UK Government has so far failed to live up to its firm commitment to ensure the Scottish Government and other devolved governments oversee the negotiations and agree objectives and outcomes. We need to move beyond words to firm commitments. Scotland&rsquo;s interests must be protected.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The Scottish Police Authority (SPA) Board will be strengthened by the appointment of seven new members.</p>
              <p>Welcoming the appointments, Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am pleased to announce the appointment of seven new members to the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) board. These new members will bring a broad range of skills and experience to the SPA, further strengthening it as it continues to scrutinise Police Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Their backgrounds and successful track records in a number of fields will enhance the SPA as we approach the fifth anniversary of police and fire reform.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This, coupled with the improvements in governance, engagement, and strategic leadership that the new Chair has initiated, will better enable the SPA to address the many new and evolving demands on Scottish policing.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Susan Deacon CBE, Chair of the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The SPA is one of Scotland&rsquo;s most important public bodies with oversight of one of our nation&rsquo;s most important public services.

              <p>Economy Secretary Keith Brown has provided an update on the opening of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR). <br />&nbsp;<br />The project had previously been expected to open during Spring 2018. Following an announcement by one of the consortium&rsquo;s partners during the posting of their annual results, that they expected the completion date to be Summer 2018, Transport Scotland conducted urgent discussions with ARL to determine whether both partners shared this view.</p>
              <p>The outcome from the discussions with ARL is that we now expect to be able to open the project in Autumn 2018. The contractor has reported there have been a number of issues that have contributed to this decision, with the impact of Storm Frank during winter 2015/16, recent extreme weather during early March and the collapse of Carillion all having an impact on the opening date.</p>
              <p>The project, equivalent in length to building a new road between Edinburgh and Glasgow, is a key part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &pound;1 billion investment in transport in the region, which includes the AWPR, Aberdeen to Inverness rail improvements and the Haudagain roundabout improvement work. the A96 dualling programme, a new junction at Laurencekirk on the A90, removing the bottleneck at Inveramsay Bridge. The largest part of this investment is the &pound;745 million AWPR project which is a significant undertaking for both the Scottish Government and the contractor.</p>
              <p>Economy Secretary Keith Brown said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;While this revision to the opening date is very disappointing to the people of the North East, we have to accept the expert advice of our contractors on the ground who are delivering this significant project.<br />&ldquo;Clearly there has been a huge amount of work that has gone in to getting the project to where we are now. I would like to pay tribute to the effort of the people who are working hard to get this project over the finishing line.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I understand how highly anticipated this project is for those living and working in the region and the patience local communities have shown during the construction process, I would like to thank them for their continued patience as we enter the final stages of the project. Transport Scotland will continue to work closely with ARL to open sections of the road at the earliest opportunity.<br />&nbsp; <br />&ldquo;The total scheme cost estimate is &pound;745 million and this remains unchanged as part of this announcement. Under the terms of the contract, ARL does not receive payment for the work until a section of road is open to traffic.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;During construction over 1,000 jobs have been created as a result of this project and it will generate over &pound;6 billion for the local economy with an anticipated 14,000 new jobs to follow over the first 30 years after the scheme opens.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Once open, the AWPR will cut congestion in and around Aberdeen city, with a positive impact on reducing emissions and improving active travel, it will also improve connectivity in the region, providing better journey time reliability, particularly for those travelling from the north of the city to the south side.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>New measures to support fair work &ndash; backed by an extra &pound;350,000 funding &ndash; have been set out by Fair Work Secretary Keith Brown and Employability Minister Jamie Hepburn.</p>
              <p>The measures include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>A further &pound;250,000 for the Trade Union Fair Work and Modernisation Fund, to promote better working practices</li>
              <li>&pound;100,000 towards the STUC&rsquo;s Fair Work: Leadership and Equality Programme</li>
              <li>A review of the Business Pledge, focused on attracting greater business buy-in and impact</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Mr Brown has also committed to publish a Fair Work Action Plan this year, which will include hosting a fair work congress to ensure open and constructive input from the widest range of expertise.</p>
              <p>Setting out the changes in a debate in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Brown said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Over the last three years, 450 businesses have committed to the Business Pledge, which celebrates companies that boost productivity and competitiveness through fair work values. I want to build on that. The review announced today will help grow the cohort of companies achieving success through innovation and employee engagement.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Extra funding&nbsp;for trade unions will allow them to expand their support of fair work practices in sectors where precarious work is prevalent, as well as deliver training for those from under-represented groups.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Fair work is central to achieving inclusive economic growth. However, we can only work within the limits of the powers at our disposal. I am calling on the UK Government to put powers around employment, social security and equality into the hands of the Scottish Government, to allow us to build on our existing work and deliver the fair and inclusive Scotland we all wish to see.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Complex work to stabilise the embankment that supports the A77 near Cairnryan has been completed, improving one of the key routes to the Irish Sea ferry ports and the essential trunk road connection linking people in the South West with the rest of Scotland .<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />It follows a pledge by Transport Minister Humza Yousaf at the South West inaugural transport summit to review the programme for delivery as a priority.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government remains committed to improving connections in the&nbsp; region with a detailed study due to get under way shortly to consider the rationale for transport improvements in the region, including the A77.</p>
              <p>Mr Yousaf said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Good and reliable transport links are essential for the local and national economy, and the A77, which serves one of Scotland&rsquo;s key commercial ports at Cairnryan, is no exception. At the region&rsquo;s first ever transport summit, I listened to concerns and acted promptly. I&rsquo;m delighted to announce that the work is complete and the traffic management system has now been removed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have invested approximately &pound;1 million to ensure the complex engineering work could be carried out as quickly and as safely as possible, with a new retaining wall now&nbsp; supporting the road.</p>
              <p>"I know that local residents were concerned at how long the work was taking, but the geography in the area presented engineers with significant challenges over a prolonged period to complete the design,&nbsp; whilst also keeping this vital route&nbsp; open and operational. We have worked closely with contractors, the community, the Action Group and ferry operators at Cairnryan to ensure the impact to road users, freight and passenger services was minimised.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This government remains absolutely committed to ensuring&nbsp; good transport links in the South West of Scotland. We have invested around &pound;85 million on six major improvements to the A77 and A75 since 2007, with &pound;30 million more planned to build a new bypass at Maybole on the A77. This is in addition to over &pound;125 million&nbsp; invested in maintaining these routes during the same period.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;All of our investment will provide better journey time reliability for motorists and businesses along the full length of the A77, as well as making safer and better connections in the region and further afield to Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Andy Fraser, Scotland TranServ&rsquo;s Operating Company Representative added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This was a complex geotechnical issue, affecting a busy freight and tourist route. The health and safety of motorists and our workers is of the utmost importance, and that&rsquo;s why it is important that the design considered all aspects of the issue and delivered a robust, long-lasting solution, supporting the needs of our communities. We will continue working with key stakeholders as we deliver our maintenance programme along the A77, with a number of projects already planned for the months ahead.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Statistics indicate poverty and inequality slowly rising in Scotland in recent years.</p>
              <p>Statistics show the incomes of poorer households fell further behind those of middle income households in recent years, pushing more people into poverty.</p>
              <p>Overall poverty rates have been relatively stable over the last decade with some fluctuations year on year. However in recent years, rising poverty rates alongside other indicators suggest low income households - especially households with children - are falling further behind those on middle incomes. Over the three-year period 2014-17, one million people in Scotland (each year) were in relative poverty after they had paid their housing costs.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>In 2014-17, 16% of people in Scotland were living in relative poverty, before housing costs, approximately 860,000 people each year. This compares to 15% in 2013-16 and suggests a slowly rising trend since the all-time low in 2011-14.</li>
              <li>After housing costs, 19% of people in Scotland were living in relative poverty in 2014-17, representing one million people each year. This is the same poverty rate as in 2013-16, but remained higher than previous years.</li>
              <li>Between 2012 and 2016, 8% of people in Scotland were in persistent poverty before housing costs, or living in poverty for three or more of the four years. This rate was the same before and after housing costs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Trends in child poverty&nbsp; are more complex. The latest estimates signal relative child poverty and in-work poverty for children continue to rise before and after housing costs, but absolute poverty and the combined low income and material deprivation rate for children have remained broadly stable, and persistent poverty appears to have fallen.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Over the three-year period 2014-17, 19% of children in Scotland, approximately 180,000 each year, were living in relative poverty before housing costs. This compares to 17% in 2013-16. After housing costs, 24% of children in Scotland were living in relative poverty in 2014-17, approximately 230,000 children. This compares to 23% in 2013-16. &nbsp;</li>
              <li>In-work poverty showed a long term rising trend since 2007-10 which continued in 2014-17 with two thirds of children in in-work poverty (both before and after housing costs), living in households with at least one member in paid work.</li>
              <li>Absolute child poverty had been falling for a long time and was broadly stable in recent years, with 15% of children in absolute poverty before housing costs in 2014-17, and 22% after housing costs, both rates the same as in the previous three-year period.</li>
              <li>In 2014-17, 10% of children were living in combined low income (before housing costs) and material deprivation, compared to 11% in 2013-16. After housing costs, 12% of children were living in combined low income and material deprivation, compared to 13% in 2013-16. Further data will be required to clarify whether this is a longer term trend.</li>
              <li>Persistent poverty rates were higher for children compared to other age groups. Before housing costs, 9% of children in Scotland were in persistent poverty between 2012 and 2016, compared to 10% in the previous period. After housing costs, in 2012-16 10% of children were in persistent poverty, compared to 14% in the previous period. Further data will be required to clarify whether this is a longer term trend.</li>
              <li>Single-year estimates of child poverty that will be required for reporting as part of the Child Poverty Act are provided in data tables in the publication.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Pensioner poverty and material deprivation present a mixed picture as well. Relative poverty for pensioners had been stable at a lower level than the other age groups for several years and may have started to rise in recent years. Pensioner material deprivation on the other hand appears to have fallen.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Relative pensioner poverty before housing cost was 17% (170,000 pensioners each year) in the three-year period 2014-17, compared to 16% in 2013-16. After housing costs, relative pensioner poverty was 13% (140,000 pensioners each year), compared to 12% in the previous three-year period.</li>
              <li>Pensioner material deprivation was 6% in 2014-17 (60,000 pensioners each year), compared to 7% in 2013-2016.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Poverty by gender, disability and ethnicity: In the three-year period 2014-17, poverty rates for single adult women were higher than for single adult men, whether or not they had children. Poverty rates for minority ethnic groups were higher than for the white ethnic group. Poverty rates for families with a disabled family member were higher than for families with nobody in the family was disabled.</p>
              <p>Income inequality has continued to rise in the three-year period 2014-17. The top ten per cent of households saw larger increases compared to lower income households. This resulted in low income households falling behind those in the middle and even further behind those at the top.</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The full statistical publications are available online:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.gov.scot/isbn/9781788516716">Poverty in Scotland</a>&nbsp;</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.gov.scot/isbn/9781788516723">Persistent Poverty in Scotland</a>&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The <strong>Poverty in Scotland</strong> publication contains information on poverty and income inequality statistics for Scotland. The data comes from the Department for Work and Pensions&rsquo; (DWP) Family Resources Survey, Households Below Average Income dataset. Comparable UK income and poverty figures are published on the same day by DWP.</p>
              <p>In this year&rsquo;s Poverty in Scotland update, the data is presented for the first time as three-year averages of each estimate. Single year estimates are still available in the associated tables. Single year estimates are best used for understanding the current situation, whereas trends over time are better identified using three-year estimates.</p>
              <p>The <strong>Persistent Poverty in Scotland</strong> publication presents estimates of how many people in Scotland live in persistent poverty. The data comes from the Understanding Society Survey.</p>
              <p><strong>Key poverty measures:</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Relative poverty: </strong>A household is in relative poverty if its income is below 60% of the middle household income in the UK (the poverty threshold). Relative poverty is a measure of whether the income of the poorest households are keeping pace with middle income households across the UK.</li>
              <li><strong>Absolute poverty</strong>: A household is in absolute poverty if its income is below the poverty threshold from 2010/11. This way, it measures whether the incomes of the poorest households are keeping pace with rising prices.</li>
              <li><strong>Combined low income and material deprivation</strong> identifies the number of children in families that cannot afford basic essential goods and services because of a low income (below 70% of the middle household income).</li>
              <li><strong>Persistent poverty</strong> identifies the number of people in relative poverty for three or more out of four years. People who live in poverty for several years are affected by it through their lifetime.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This publication presents poverty figures <strong>before and after housing costs</strong>. Before housing costs figures are a basic measure of household income from earnings and benefits. After housing costs figures subtract spending on rents, mortgage interest payments and other unavoidable housing costs from this basic income.</p>
              <p>Further<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Social-Welfare"> information on income and poverty statistics</a> within Scotland is available online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Official statistics are produced by professionally independent statistical staff &ndash; more information on the <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/About">standards of official statistics</a> in Scotland can be assessed online.</p>

              <p>The number of people registered to vote in elections in Scotland has increased in 2017, according figures published today by National Records of Scotland. This is the second successive year that the Scottish electorate has increased, following the previous drop in numbers caused by the introduction of Individual Electoral Registration (IER). The latest increase is seen across the electorates for the UK Parliament, Scottish Parliament and Local Government.</p>
              <p>As at 1 December 2017:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The number of UK Parliamentary electors in Scotland rose by 20,700 (0.5%) to 3.95 million, compared to December 2016</li>
              <li>The number of registered Local Government and Scottish Parliament electors in Scotland rose by 31,700 (0.8%) to 4.12 million</li>
              <li>There were increases to the electorate for 43 out of 59 UK Parliament constituencies, 57 out of 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies and 245 out of 354 Local Government electoral wards</li>
              <li>The number of electors who are (non-UK) EU nationals increased by 11,800 (10.4%) on the previous year to 125,000. This is the highest recorded level of EU nationals registered to vote in Scotland, but the year-on-year change is smaller than was seen between December 2015 and December 2016 (when it increased by 17,200)</li>
              <li>The number of 16 and 17 year olds registered to vote in Local Government and Scottish Parliament elections increased by 3,900 (4.9%) to 83,500, compared to December 2016.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Background</p>
              <ol>
              <li>The full publication &lsquo;Electoral Statistics for Scotland, as at 1 December 2017&rsquo; is available on the <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/electoral-statistics">NRS website</a>.</li>
              <li>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) have also today published electoral statistics for the whole of the UK, which NRS supplied the Scottish figures for. This is available on the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/elections/electoralregistration">ONS website</a>.</li>
              <li>Resident EU nationals do not have the right to vote in UK Parliament elections, but can vote in Scottish Parliament and Local Government Elections.</li>
              <li>The data source used to produce electoral statistics holds limited information about voter age and no information about the sex of a voter.&nbsp;</li>

              <p>An Independent Advisory Group on Biometric Data has recommended a series of changes to how such data is used by Police Scotland.</p>
              <p>The group, established by Justice Secretary Michael Matheson last year and chaired by John Scott QC Solicitor Advocate, examined the acquisition, retention, use and disposal of data such as DNA, fingerprints, facial and other photographic images, and what improvements could be made to the regime governing this.</p>
              <p>Their recommendations include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Creating a new code of practice on the acquisition, retention, use and disposal of biometric data</li>
              <li>Reviewing the legal rules on retention of data in the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 to consider questions of proportionality and necessity</li>
              <li>Encouraging a &lsquo;national debate&rsquo; to improve public understanding of and confidence in the use of biometric data</li>
              <li>Establishing an independent Scottish Biometrics Commissioner to monitor compliance with the code.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Mr Matheson said:</p>
              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s national forensics service is widely recognised as a scientific leader, supporting Police Scotland on serious and major crime investigations to help tackle those who prey on our communities, track down perpetrators, bringing them to justice and keeping communities safe.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;While the 2016 independent report of the HM Inspector found that Police Scotland was making proportionate and necessary use of biometric data and technologies, it identified a need for improved oversight of these arrangements.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government accepts the Group&rsquo;s report and the thrust of its recommendations. While the creation of a new Biometrics Commissioner to monitor compliance with a new code will require careful consideration and discussions with the parliamentary authorities, it is one that we accept in principle.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The public should continue to have confidence in how their information is held and I hope that the publication of this report will kick-start a wider debate on biometric data and how it is best used to help keep our communities safe.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Chair of the Independent Advisory Group and human rights lawyer John Scott added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Just under ten years ago, the European Court of Human Rights commented with approval on the regime in Scotland for regulating the retention of DNA samples and profiles. Around the same time, the Scottish Government commissioned an independent review into the regulation of matters relating to DNA and fingerprints which led to necessary changes in the law.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Since then, there have been continuing developments in these and other areas of biometric technologies. This review offers the opportunity to take account of these and future developments and develop a framework for the regulation of all policing aspects of biometric data, reflecting the significance of such data in policing as well as all ethical and human rights considerations.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Gillian MacDonald said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Biometric data, particularly DNA, fingerprints and photographs, is a critical tool in the investigation and prevention of crime. We recognise the importance of ensuring that the public has trust and confidence in the procedures which govern its use.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Any endeavour to strengthen the legislative framework and provide a balance between keeping the public safe from harm whilst ensuring the appropriate consideration of human rights and ethics is welcomed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Police Scotland, having been a key contributor to the work of the Biometrics Independent Advisory Group, supports all of the recommendations and will continue to play a significant part in any future work."<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

              <p>A new specialist recruitment facility will bring 200 jobs to Glasgow this year.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Centre of Excellence is being opened by international recruitment firm SThree, which provides specialist recruitment services for the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) industries and has 40 offices across 16 countries.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The investment is backed by &pound;2million Regional Selective Assistance funding from Scottish Enterprise.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Economy Secretary Keith Brown said: &ldquo;This facility will be a major jobs boost for Glasgow, with 200 new posts this year and 314 in total over the next three years. And it will support our ambition for Scotland to be a STEM nation with our economy at the forefront of the technological frontier.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
              <p>&ldquo;The &pound;2million funding from Scottish Enterprise also gives them access to the excellent business support network here in Scotland. And our communities will benefit from the work of the innovative SThree Foundation which supports young people from underprivileged and diverse backgrounds to transition successfully into STEM higher education, jobs and apprenticeships.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Alex Smith, SThree&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officer, said: &ldquo;Investing in Glasgow gives us access to a highly-skilled workforce and an excellent business infrastructure. The STEM markets in which we operate are growing rapidly and this new centre in Glasgow will strengthen our operational capability and support expanding teams across our main markets.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our new Centre of Excellence will bring together our UK support services and underpin our future business needs in the most efficient way. In making this new investment in Glasgow, we have had tremendous support from the Scottish Government and SDI.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Paul Lewis, interim chief executive of Scottish Enterprise said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic to see a company like SThree, with a strong focus on STEM industries, expanding in Scotland. That the company is planning to create 200 new jobs this year alone is a true endorsement of Scotland&rsquo;s strength in these sectors, as evidenced by our growing reputation in areas like data, technology and R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The decision by SThree to select Glasgow for this expansion is further evidence of Scotland&rsquo;s attractiveness, backing up our position as the leading UK location for inward investment outside London, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to working with the company to support its ambitious growth plans for Scotland.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Legislation to protect Scotland&rsquo;s devolved powers has been passed overwhelmingly by the Scottish Parliament.</p>
              <p>The new legislation will both protect the devolved settlement and prepare Scotland&rsquo;s laws for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill will come into effect if the Scottish Parliament decides not to consent to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill and will prevent what ministers in Scotland and Wales have described as a &ldquo;power grab&rdquo;.</p>
              <p>The Welsh National Assembly has today passed similar legislation for devolved matters in Wales.</p>
              <p>Michael Russell, the Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government is opposed to leaving the EU in line with the overwhelming majority of people in Scotland, but we have a duty to prepare our laws for Brexit.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;However, Brexit must not be used by the UK Government as cover to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament and hand them to Westminster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I am delighted that the majority of the Scottish Parliament has come together to support devolution. The process of working through, and improving this bill, has been a credit to our national parliament and demonstrates the strength of feeling over this issue.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The parliament has been clear that it could not recommend consent to the UK Government&rsquo;s EU Withdrawal Bill, as it stands, as it allows the UK Government to unilaterally take control of devolved powers.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are still committed to discussions with the UK Government. We now expect them to acknowledge the overwhelming view expressed by the Scottish Parliament &ndash; and the Welsh National Assembly &ndash; and come forward with proposals that respect the devolution settlement and allow us to come to an agreement.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Assistant Inspector of Constabulary in Scotland Gillian Imery QPM is to be appointed Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary in Scotland.</p>
              <p>As Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Gillian Imery will lead HM Inspectorate of Constabulary Scotland (HMICS) to deliver an annual programme of independent inspection, monitoring and evaluation of Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority.</p>
              <p>Mrs Imery will also be a source of professional independent advice on police matters, publishing reports of inspections and producing an annual report to Ministers on the police service in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;HMICS plays a vital role in ensuring Scotland&rsquo;s police continue to perform their duties to a high standard as they strive to keep Scotland&rsquo;s communities safe.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;With a career spanning over 30 years in Scottish Policing, most recently as Assistant Inspector of Constabulary, Gillian Imery brings with her a wealth of experience to the role of Chief Inspector of Constabulary in Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am confident that Mrs Imery&rsquo;s invaluable policing background and time already spent in HMICS will stand her in good stead as the new Chief Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Thanking outgoing Chief Inspector, Derek Penman, Mr Matheson added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am very grateful to Derek for his unstinting service to the public over 33 years in policing, including four years as HM Chief Inspector for Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;He has provided significant, independent oversight and challenge to the service and the Scottish Police Authority, at a key time for policing and I wish him well in whatever he chooses to do next.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Mrs Imery said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am extremely proud to have been appointed to the role of HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary in Scotland, and am optimistic about the part HMICS can play in supporting improvement in policing for the benefit of the Scottish public. I believe it is important to have independent and objective scrutiny of policing to ensure challenging issues are addressed as well as to highlight the positive contribution policing makes to our communities.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Commenting on the latest Labour Market Statistics, released by the ONS for November to January 2018, Minister for Employability and Training Jamie Hepburn said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;While these results do show a slight decrease in employment over the quarter, our employment rate has increased over the year and the longer term, 1.0 percentage points higher compared with last year, and showing 80,000 more people in employment compared to the pre-recession peak.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Once more, we continue to outperform the UK on employment and unemployment rates for young people and women, 71.5. % of women and 58.8 % of young people are in employment in Scotland compared to 70.9% of women and 54.5% of young people in the UK.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our support for young people includes a commitment to train at least 28,000 new apprentices next year, including opportunities at degree level, and 5,000 Foundation Apprenticeships in the senior phase of Curriculum for Excellence, by 2020.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Despite the UK Government&rsquo;s pursuit of a punishing programme of austerity, which continues to squeeze both individuals and businesses around Scotland, we are committed to investing to support economic growth.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;However, Brexit remains the single biggest concern to Scottish businesses, and the greatest threat to our economy. Our latest analysis, confirmed by the UK Government&rsquo;s own research, shows Brexit could cost Scotland&rsquo;s economy &pound;12.7 billion a year by 2030.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Projects that help people move away from emergency food support and get access to healthy, nutritious food will be offered funding for a further year.</p>
              <p>The &pound;1 million a year Fair Food Fund is being continued in 2018-19 to enable existing projects to continue their work. In addition, a further &pound;1 million over the next two years will fund new activity to support children facing food insecurity, particularly during school holidays.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Equalities Secretary Angela Constance made the announcement on a visit to Central and West Integration Network, a Fair Food Fund supported project in Glasgow. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>Ms Constance said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;No child should go hungry in a country as prosperous as ours. We provide free school meals for all pupils in P1-3 and for those from a low income background throughout their time at school. But it&rsquo;s clear that for some families, facing a daily struggle to make ends meet, there is an issue providing nutritious food out of school terms.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I want to address that so I&rsquo;m pleased to announce we will be investing an additional &pound;1 million over the next two year to focus specifically on supporting children in this situation.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am also delighted that we will continue to support existing Fair Food Fund projects for a further year. This funding is making a real difference for people, and projects like the Central and West Integration Network are delivering vital support that enables people to access meals, learn new skills, make new friends and contribute to their local community.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Peter Taylor, Chair of Central and West Integration Network, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Central and West Integration Network supports asylum seekers and refugees, migrant workers and black and minority ethnic people, and works with all communities to promote integration in the City Centre, West End of Glasgow, and beyond. Our work includes regular community meals and food distribution.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Many of the people we help face long term food insecurity because of their legal status.&nbsp; The Fair Food Fund allows us to do more than help to meet their food needs.&nbsp; It enables us to do this in a socially supportive environment where opportunities for learning, positive activities and meeting people from other communities are provided.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background </strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/fairerscotland/tacklingpovertyinscotland/food-poverty">Fair Food Fund</a> aims to ensure that everyone can feed themselves and their families and reduce reliance on emergency food provision.&nbsp; The fund supports community projects that offer dignified and sustainable responses to food poverty.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government has adopted the &lsquo;<a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/fairerscotland/tacklingpovertyinscotland/food-poverty">Dignity Principles</a>&rsquo; developed by the Independent Short Life Working Group on Food Poverty (June 2016) to inform how we direct the Fund.</p>
              <p>The additional &pound;1 million investment (&pound;500,000 per year in 2018-19 and 2019-20) will be focused on supporting children who can experience increased food insecurity during school holidays.&nbsp; The specific activities to be supported will be defined in consultation with key partners over the coming months.</p>

              <p>The latest quarterly Scottish Government Workforce Information statistics have been published today by Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Statistician. These statistics cover the numbers of workers, staff sickness rates, and the diversity of staff, up to the most recent quarter ending December 2017.</p>
              <p>The statistics show that:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>At the end of December 2017, there were 5,535 FTE (Full Time Equivalent) directly employed staff, an increase from last year&rsquo;s figure of 5,149 at the end of December 2016. The percentage of directly employed staff in permanent (96%) and temporary (4%) categories was similar to the same period last year (December 2016: 97%, 3%).</li>
              <li>There was a 14% increase in the number of contingent (non-directly employed) workers, from 992 at the end of December 2016, to 1,131 at the end of December 2017, an increase of 139 workers.</li>
              <li>The staff sickness level was 7.4 average working days lost (AWDL) per staff year in the 12 month period ending December 2017 (3.3% of working days were lost). This is the same number of AWDL for the same period last year (7.4 AWDL December 2016).</li>
              <li>At the end of December 2017, just over half (51.2%) of the workforce were female, compared to 48.8% male. The proportion of female staff is similar compared to the same period last year (50.9% December 2016).</li>
              <li>The majority of staff were aged 40-49 (28.4%), 50-59 (27.3%) and 30-39 (24.5%) at the end of December 2017. In contrast, 13.5% were aged 16-29, and 6.4% were aged 60 or over.</li>
              <li>The proportions of directly employed staff providing diversity information on ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation and religion or belief have all increased since the same period last year.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The figures released today were produced in accordance with professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>
              <p>The full statistics are available at: <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/workforce-information/">https://beta.gov.scot/publications/workforce-information/</a></p>
              <p>The statistics contain quarterly data from March 2012 to December 2017 and present:&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>full time equivalent numbers and headcounts in each directly employed staff category</li>
              <li>headcounts of contingent workers (non-directly employed workers) engaged in work for the Scottish Government</li>
              <li>sickness absence levels of directly employed staff</li>
              <li>headcounts of directly employed staff by: age, disability status, ethnicity, gender, marital/civil partnership status, religion or belief, and sexual orientation</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Scottish Government uses the data internally to monitor the performance of its workforce. Other expected users of the data are likely to include the general public and media for information about the Scottish Government, and other government departments for comparative purposes.</p>
              <p>Official statistics are produced by professionally independent statistical staff. More information on the standards of official statistics in Scotland can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/About">http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/About</a></p>

              <p>Recruitment is now open for the first jobs with Scotland&rsquo;s new social security agency.</p>
              <p>Successful applicants will help people to access the support that they are entitled to and will help to deliver the first payments for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance Supplement this summer.</p>
              <p>The positions will be offered with various working patterns meaning more than 80 people are expected to be employed with some of the full time posts being covered by multiple part time workers.</p>
              <p>These jobs are the first of at least 1,900 that will be created by the time the agency is fully operational.</p>
              <p>Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is another important step towards creating Scotland&rsquo;s first social security agency which will be based on our principles of dignity, fairness and respect.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are looking for people with positive attitudes who share our ambition to deliver a public service that people in Scotland can be proud of.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Dignity and respect can&rsquo;t be limited to the way we deliver our service. It has to be evident in how we treat our staff. So we&rsquo;re starting recruitment now to make sure we have the time to offer all successful applicants the training and support they&rsquo;ll need to do their best in their new roles.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government is committed to family friendly working and a healthy work/life balance and we&rsquo;re determined to do all we can to bring in the many skills and experience you get from a diverse workforce. So we&rsquo;ll be offering job opportunities with a wide variety of working patterns&rdquo;</p>
              <p>These jobs are the first of approximately 750 new roles in Dundee, which will be Social Security Scotland&rsquo;s new headquarters. A similar number of people will be employed at a second site in Glasgow with at least 400 more jobs being created to deliver support at a local level across Scotland.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Forestry in Scotland will be fully devolved to&nbsp;the Scottish Parliament for the first time after MSPs backed the Forestry and Land Management (Scotland) Bill.</p>
              <p>Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said the bill&rsquo;s modern approach to forestry development, support and regulation will enable the Scottish Government to better support the &pound;1 billion industry and 25,000 jobs within the sector, to create growth in the rural economy, mitigate climate change and develop the role forestry plays in health, education and recreation.</p>
              <p>The bill will deliver:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Improved accountability, transparency and policy alignment as forestry will be fully accountable to Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament</li>
              <li>A modern legislative framework to develop, support and regulate forestry in Scotland</li>
              <li>More effective use of Scotland&rsquo;s publicly owned land. The National Forest Estate will be managed to deliver economic, environmental and social outcomes and the Scottish Government will be able to offer land management experience and expertise to others.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In order to deliver their new functions, the Scottish Government will create two new agencies and intends to retain the expertise and skills of existing staff in the new arrangements.</p>
              <p>Welcoming the passage of the Forestry and Land Management (Scotland) Bill, Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government is focused on ensuring that there is a bright future for forestry in Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am extremely proud to have been the Cabinet Secretary to lead this landmark legislation &ndash; the first ever bill on forestry in the devolved era - and crucially, the legislation fully devolves forestry to Scotland.</p>
              <p>"It is disappointing that we will now not be able to forge ahead with our planned arrangements but I will absolutely respect and deliver the will of Parliament. In working out how to deliver what Parliament wants, I will do all I can to provide as much pace, clarity and certainty to ensure that the staff working currently in Forestry Commission Scotland and Forest Enterprise Scotland can move swiftly and seamlessly to the new administrative arrangements.&nbsp; They are key to the future of forestry &ndash;our ambitions will not be delivered without their skills and expertise and I want them to feel valued and respected in the process ahead.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Act will give Scotland the modern framework needed to support more tree planting, sustain existing woodlands and create new ones, while also maintaining our forests. We have a sector worth &pound;1 billion to our economy, supporting over 25,000 jobs, and providing huge social and recreational opportunities for all our population.&nbsp; Our forests, woodlands and trees form a key part of our countryside &ndash; they are natural assets I am determined to nurture and grow for current and future generations.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The bill introduces new statutory requirements to promote sustainable forest management and to produce a forestry strategy, as well as putting in place the foundations of a modern, flexible and more effective regulatory regime for felling.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Steps are being taken to safeguard a Scottish flame shell reef &ndash; as the Scottish Government consults to create a permanent Marine Protected Area (MPA).</p>
              <p>Loch Carron, on the north west coast, has the world&rsquo;s largest flame shell bed, home to an estimated 250 million of the brightly coloured molluscs.</p>
              <p>Loch Carron was designated as an emergency MPA in May 2017, following confirmation of damage to the flame shell beds by a dredging incident. A Marine Conservation Order was put in place at the same time to manage fishing activity. The consultation will seek views on creating a permanent MPA covering the whole of Loch Carron.</p>
              <p>Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland has some of the most beautiful and diverse marine ecosystems in the world and the flame shells at Loch Carron are of international importance.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;That is why we are taking new measures to protect these amazing ecosystems to ensure they are safeguarded for future generations to enjoy the benefits of them, which are often taken for granted.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This consultation is a key step to ensuring Loch Carron is given permanent marine protection to ensure the recovery of the flame shell beds in Loch Carron.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>Loch Carron survey work in 2017 also identified maerl beds, another vulnerable habitat, which will also be protected.</p>
              <p>These habitats play an important role in the health of the sea &ndash; flame shells clean the water and maerl beds are a vital blue carbon store.&nbsp; They both provide a nursery habitat for a wide range of species, including commercially important ones such as scallops.</p>
              <p>Protected areas are one of the mechanisms used to ensure protection of some of the most vulnerable species and habitats.</p>
              <p>The Scottish MPA network covers approximately 20% of our seas and comprises 168 sites.</p>
              <p>The existing protection remains in place throughout this process.</p>

              <p>The Scottish Government will provide &pound;150,000 to match private sponsorship secured by the theatre.</p>
              <p>This package of public and private funding will allow the theatre to continue to operate throughout 2018 - including fulfilling&nbsp; important activity in the Year of Young People. It will give them an opportunity to identify a long-term funding solution, and to consider how to further develop work beyond Glasgow, and any partnerships that would make that possible.</p>
              <p>Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Youth Theatre has supported many young actors and other theatre professionals to find their voice and launch their careers. There was widespread concern about the announcement that the theatre was facing closure due to its financial position.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This funding from partners will allow the theatre to maintain its work, and complete the ongoing positive changes to their business. It will also give time for further dialogue about a longer-term funding strategy.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I have set out this offer to the Scottish Youth Theatre, and I have encouraged them to continue exploring all options available to secure a more permanent funding solution. I have also discussed with them their continuing ambitions to improve the reach, depth and quality of Scottish Youth Theatre&rsquo;s work across Scotland, and how this funding will help them towards that goal.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Investment through charitable bonds has enabled more than 1,000 new affordable homes to have been built since 2014.</p>
              <p>Charitable bonds are a way of providing loans to social housing providers, which are repaid over a period of up to ten years. The 2018/19 budget for charitable investments is increasing from &pound;25 million to &pound;40 million, generating an estimated &pound;10 million through interest raised on the bonds.</p>
              <p>Announcing the additional funding on a visit to Kingdom Housing Association&rsquo;s regeneration &nbsp;project in Kincardine, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said:&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are always looking at ways we can increase the supply of affordable housing and support developers, housing associations and councils get new projects off the ground.&nbsp; Part of our pledge to deliver 50,000 affordable homes is to make the most of existing public funds and secure additional private sector investment.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are the only government in the UK to invest in charitable bonds. The interest we receive from the bonds is given to social housing providers and is another important step towards achieving our target for affordable homes.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Phil Caroe, Director of Social Finance at Allia, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Allia&rsquo;s charitable bond programme with Scottish Government has been a great success over the last three years, offering a unique source of&nbsp; finance that is supporting new developments around the country.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted that the Scottish Government is now increasing its funding for this programme, which will result in even more people in Scotland being able to live in an affordable home.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Bill Banks Chief Executive with Kingdom Housing Association said:</p>
              <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;At Kingdom we are progressing an increased development programme, which will contribute to the 50,000 target and we are aiming to optimise the range of funding sources available to support and deliver the programme.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Allia charitable bond funding of &pound;15.25 million drawn by Kingdom so far is a welcomed addition to this portfolio supporting delivery of up to 293 affordable homes.&rsquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The Kincardine development by Kingdom Housing Association includes 49 mixed tenure affordable homes, partly funded from charitable bond loans.</p>
              <p>By March 2018 the Scottish Government had invested in 16 <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/more-homes/innovative-financing/">charitable bonds</a> ,providing almost &pound;95 million development finance for more than 1,000 affordable homes, and generating in excess of &pound;20 million in additional charitable bond donations for social housing projects.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s investment in Allia&rsquo;s charitable bonds has to date provided loans to 11 housing associations across Scotland.&nbsp; The interest on these loans will create a grant fund of &pound;20 million to support the delivery of houses for those on the lowest incomes.</p>

              <p>Olivia and Jack remain the most popular baby names in Scotland, and Smith, Brown and Wilson the three top surnames, according to figures published today by National Records of Scotland (NRS).</p>
              <p>The full lists of first names given to babies whose births were registered in 2017 replace the top 100 lists published in December, and include the first name of every baby, including those whose births were registered in December.</p>
              <p>The three top surnames in the Birth, Marriage and Death registers for 2017 - Smith, Brown and Wilson - have been the most common surnames recorded in the registers for over 40 years, based on five-yearly analysis going back to 1975.</p>
              <p>The NRS website includes annual lists of babies&rsquo; first forenames back to 1974, and information about how the top names have changed. Many names which were once very popular have gone out of fashion. A table of the Top Ten names for each sex for 1975 and for every fifth year thereafter, shows that (for example):</p>
              <ul>
              <li>for girls, none of the names that were in the Top Ten in 1975 appeared in the Top Ten in 2000 or 2015, and none of the Top Ten in 2000 survived into the Top Ten in 2015;</li>
              <li>Nicola, which was the top name in 1975, had dropped out of the Top Ten by 1995 (when Nicole was in the Top Ten). Karen, second in 1975, had gone from the Top Ten by 1985; Susan, third in 1975, had gone by 1980;</li>
              <li>for boys, David, John and Paul, which were the Top Three in 1975, did not appear anywhere in the Top Ten in 2000 or 2015. Paul had dropped out by 1990, John by 1995 and David by 2000;</li>
              <li>James, fourth in 1975, is the only name which has been in its Top Ten in every one of the selected years;</li>

              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will visit China next month to promote the growing economic, cultural and educational links between Scotland and the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy.</p>
              <p>She will visit Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong between April 9 and 13, conducting a series of high-level business and government meetings, as well as education showcases, cultural engagements and other events.</p>
              <p>This will be the First Minister&rsquo;s first visit to China since 2015, and comes on the back of strengthening international links between the two countries.</p>
              <p>Latest figures show that goods exports from Scotland to China are increasing at a faster rate than to any of Scotland&rsquo;s other top five export partners, with a rise of more than 40% last year.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the first direct Scotland-China air route was announced last week, with Hainan Airlines set to offer a twice-weekly service between Edinburgh and Beijing from June this year.</p>
              <p>In December last year, the First Minister met with Vice Premier Liu Yandong in Edinburgh during her visit to the UK.</p>
              <p>Announcing her visit, the First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am delighted to be visiting China to promote the long-standing friendship between our two countries.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Since my last visit three years ago, the economic and cultural links between Scotland and China have gone from strength to strength, underlined by the recent strong export figures and the new direct Edinburgh-Beijing flight route announced last week.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As the world&rsquo;s second largest economy, there are huge opportunities for Scottish companies to work with China. I will be travelling with the message that Scotland is a fantastic place to invest, to do business, to study and to visit on holiday.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;During my visit I will meet with senior Chinese Government representatives and I look forward to exploring new ways that our two countries can work together for the mutual benefit of all our people. As with my previous meetings, we will continue to talk about the importance of equality of opportunity and respect for human rights.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Liz Cameron OBE, Director and Chief Executive of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This visit is a great example of how business and government can mobilise our respective strengths to do what's best for the Scottish economy and forge new international business alliances. Our highest priority is to make sure that Scotland remains open for business to the rest of the world. That means being able to trade and invest easily with international markets, and Scotland remaining an attractive destination for inward investment.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Chamber Network&rsquo;s Business Mission to China will see Scottish companies meet directly with Chinese suppliers, investors and buyers, providing commercial business opportunities and partnership exchanges. With our dedicated Scottish Trade Office&nbsp;in Yantai, coupled with Scotland&rsquo;s entrepreneurial business diaspora and the unparalleled reach of the Scottish Chamber Network, I am confident we will deepen the business to business relationships between Scotland and China and grow our economy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Karen Betts, Chief Executive at the Scotch Whisky Association, said:</p>
              <p>"We're very pleased that the First Minster is going to China, where there are many exciting exporting opportunities for Scottish businesses, including, for Scotch Whisky. This visit is a chance to forge even closer ties with the world's largest spirits market, both now and into the future.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As Scotland's largest food and drink export, accounting for &pound;4.36bn in trade and supporting thousands of jobs in Scotland, China represents a huge opportunity for growth for Scotch Whisky. Exports to China increased by 47% last year along as more Chinese consumers start appreciating the heritage, craft and quality of Scotch."</p>
              <p><strong>Background: </strong></p>
              <p>There were &pound;2.2 billion of exports from Scotland to China in 2017 compared with &pound;1.6 billion in 2016 &ndash; a rise of 41.2%.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/686571/RTS_Q4_2017.pdf"><em>HMRC Regional Trade in Goods Statistics.

              <p>Transport Scotland has today published its strategy for investment in rail improvements over the next decade.</p>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/publication/rail-enhancements-capital-investment-strategy/">Rail Enhancements &amp; Capital Investment Strategy</a><em>, </em>which signals a move to &lsquo;pipeline-based approach&rsquo;, sets out how funding will be targeted across the Scottish rail network.</p>
              <p>The pipeline system places emphasis on a whole system approach to investment, ensuring best use of public funds at every stage of project design, development and delivery.</p>
              <p>Humza Yousaf, Minister for Transport and the Islands said:</p>
              <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt from the experience of this and previous Control Periods. We&rsquo;ve listened to the views of local communities and the rail industry.&nbsp; Our strategy will bring to life the new pipeline approach.&nbsp; It will deliver a framework for rail investment with a sharp focus on the right solutions for passengers and freight users, greater efficiency, oversight and value for money&rsquo;.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Despite our strong track record since 2007, future investment in Scotland&rsquo;s railways is set against a real terms reduction in rail funding from the UK Government, which threatens sustainable, progressive investment in rail services. The decisions of the UK Government have created a gap of &pound;460m of the funding that the rail industry has advised us it needs to deliver the improvements required to meet demands for rail.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&lsquo;Transport Scotland will be hosting a series of workshops across the country, where stakeholders and interested groups can find out more about the strategy, as well as how to apply for the recently announced <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/public-transport/rail/rail-policy-and-strategy/local-rail-development-fund/">Local Rail Development Fund</a>.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Dr John McCormick, Chairman of the Scottish Association of Public Transport said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The workshops will provide a great opportunity to understand how the new process will operate and how we might influence future investment decisions. Having campaigned for many years for rail improvements, we are very interested to hear how the Local Rail Development Fund can assist local communities to achieve their objectives. &nbsp;We will certainly be attending and encourage all those associations, organisations and groups with an interest in Scotland&rsquo;s railway to do likewise.<strong>&rdquo;</strong></p>
              <p>Stakeholder groups can register for more information by emailing: <a href="mailto:Rail.Infrastructure.Strategy@transport.gov.scot">Rail.Infrastructure.Strategy@transport.gov.scot</a></p>

              <p>More young people will be able to get involved in the First Minister&rsquo;s Reading Challenge as it expands to include secondary schools, libraries and community groups.</p>
              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement at Riverside Primary School in Stirling &ndash; the winner of the School and Community Partnership Reading Journey award for its participation in the challenge.</p>
              <p>An evaluation of the programme&rsquo;s first year found the response from schools and families has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>
              <p>The First Minister said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Raising attainment is at the heart of&nbsp; the Scottish Government&rsquo;s work and reading for pleasure from an early age can help develop children&rsquo;s literacy. That is why I launched the First Minister&rsquo;s Reading Challenge and I&rsquo;m thrilled it has received such positive feedback from schools, teachers and pupils.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Riverside Primary School is a fantastic example of how schools have tailored the Reading Challenge to suit their own needs, resulting in a positive reading culture in the school.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I want to ensure the Reading Challenge continues to grow and have a positive impact on children so I have accepted all of the recommendations of the Reading Challenge Advisory Group which are based on the evaluation and look forward to another successful year of reading.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Riverside Primary School Headteacher Kay Robertson said:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We signed up to the Reading Challenge to further inspire our children in their love of reading and help us raise attainment and it&rsquo;s been a tremendous success. We were delighted to win the Community Partnership award last year, recognising the dedication of our staff, children and members of the wider community.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really proud of our refurbished school library which is used by the children on a daily basis and is also available for members of the community to use to promote inter-generational reading activities.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="http://scottishbooktrust.com/learning/teachers-librarians/first-ministers-reading-challenge/evaluation">evaluation</a> for 2016-17 and the Advisory Group&rsquo;s full recommendations are available online.</p>

              <p>Scotland&rsquo;s health and social care services can be shielded from the worst impacts of Brexit by maintaining membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, Health Secretary Shona Robison will say this week.</p>
              <p>Ms Robison will reiterate the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position following evidence from health experts that highlights risks to research, clinical trials, and access to medicines and staff.</p>
              <p>The Health Secretary will give evidence on Tuesday to the Health and Sport Committee&rsquo;s inquiry on the impact of leaving the European Union on health in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Speaking ahead of the session, Shona Robison said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;EU workers make a vital contribution to our health and social care services, filling vacancies in hard-to-recruit specialisms or areas. However, evidence from health experts has demonstrated huge risks to workforce recruitment and retention if the free movement of workers and the cross-border recognition of qualifications, education and training are diminished.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am clear that the only way to protect patients, our health and social care services, and our research and pharmaceutical industries is to retain our membership of the Single Market and Customs Union.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This would ensure we continue to benefit&nbsp; from recognition of qualifications and free movement of staff within the EU, the rights of Scottish patients to have treatment in the EU, and access for Scotland to pan-European research, medicines and clinical trials. All of that is jeopardised by a lack of clear information from the UK Government.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Leaving the EU&rsquo;s regulatory regime for medicines and medical devices could also affect patients, with potential for slower or reduced access to new medicines, equipment or vitally important clinical trials. There will also be a negative economic impact on our pharmaceutical and medical devices industries.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The only way Scotland can protect itself from the worst of this is stay inside the Single Market and Customs Union.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>All homes will have the highest level of protection from smoke and fire.</p>
              <p>Following a consultation on fire and smoke alarms, the existing high standard required in private rented housing will be extended to all homes.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>This includes at least one smoke alarm installed in the room most frequently used, at least one smoke alarm in spaces such as hallways and landings and at least one heat alarm in every kitchen.&nbsp; Additional requirements will include specifying a maximum age of ten years for alarms and a carbon monoxide detector will be required in all homes.</p>
              <p>Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Fires and fatalities from fires are decreasing but even one death is one too many.&nbsp; Scotland already has rigorous standards for smoke and fire alarms developed over time, with the highest standard currently applied to new-build and private rented housing.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The tragic events at Grenfell Tower last year emphasised how important building and fire safety is, which is why we brought forward our consultation on this issue.&nbsp; Now everyone will benefit from the same level of protection, whether you own your home, or rent from a social or private landlord.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>ACO David McGown, SFRS Director of Prevention and Protection said;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The presence of working smoke and heat detectors have been proven to significantly reduce casualties and fatalities occurring as a result of fires within the home. &nbsp;SFRS therefore welcome and support&nbsp;the next steps from this consultation which will undoubtedly improve home safety for all residents, regardless of tenure.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/housing-regeneration-and-welfare/fire-and-smoke-alarms-in-scottish-homes/">consultation on fire and smoke alarms</a> has now closed and responses are available to view.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2018/03/9509">analysis</a>&nbsp;of responses is also available to view.</p>
              <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 will be amended to reflect the new requirements.&nbsp; The amended standard will cover all homes. &nbsp;Once the Act has been amended there will be a two year grace period for compliance. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>The existing standard required in private rented housing will be extended to all tenures of housing. This would require:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>at least one smoke alarm installed in the room most frequently used for general daytime living purposes,</li>
              <li>at least one smoke alarm in every circulation space on each storey, such as hallways and landings,</li>
              <li>at least one heat alarm installed in every kitchen,</li>
              <li>all alarms should be ceiling mounted, and</li>
              <li>all alarms should be interlinked.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The following changes to this standard, all supported by the responses to the consultation, are also proposed:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>to allow specified types of sealed long-life battery alarms as well as mains-wired alarms - reflecting the availability of appropriate technology and will encourage compliance;</li>
              <li>to specify a maximum age of ten years for alarms; and</li>
              <li>to require carbon monoxide detectors in all homes.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If occupants are private tenants, the landlord is required to meet their duty to repair and maintain its properties as set out in the repairing standard under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006.&nbsp; Private tenants can apply to the<a href="https://www.mygov.scot/organisations/housing-and-property-chamber/"> First-Tier Tribunal</a>&nbsp;for assistance if landlords fail to carry out work needed to meet the repairing standard. &nbsp;Private landlords are already required to ensure rented homes have fire and smoke alarms to the new standard.</p>
              <p>If occupants are social tenants, the landlord is expected to meet their duty to ensure that property meets the Scottish Housing Quality Standard.&nbsp; The Scottish Housing Regulator monitors landlords performance against this standard. Social tenants have a right of complaint against their landlord to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman. Social landlords are already required to ensure homes have fire and smoke alarms, but not to the new standard.</p>
              <p>Following the fire at Grenfell Tower, a Ministerial Working Group on Building and Fire Safety was established to review Scotland&rsquo;s building and fire safety regulatory frameworks.&nbsp; As part of this work, the Group agreed that consultation on fire and smoke alarm standards should be prioritised.</p>

              <p>The Scottish Government is taking steps to build stronger connections with France &ndash; Scotland&rsquo;s third largest export market and a significant cultural partner.</p>
              <p>That was the message from Culture and External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop, as she undertook a series of high level engagements in Paris.</p>
              <p>During the visit, she&nbsp;met culture partners and institutional contacts, including French Ministers and Government representatives.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Speaking after a meeting with French Government Minister for Europe Nathalie Loiseau, where they discussed Scotland&rsquo;s position on Brexit, opportunities for collaboration between Scotland and France and shared international interests, Ms Hyslop said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I had a very productive meeting with Mme Loiseau and I am pleased to see we share the same objectives for the future of our respective nations.&nbsp; France and Scotland are both outward looking countries with strong international links that we must strengthen.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Scotland and France have a long history and I am confident our commitment to open a new Innovation and Investment Hub in Paris later this year will further strengthen our diplomatic, economic and cultural ties with our French neighbours.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Despite the threat posed by Brexit, we are committed to reassuring our partners that Scotland is an open and forward-looking nation &ndash; one which invests in cultural collaborations and is keen to boost its trade and investment links internationally.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;As set out in our recently published paper, all the scenarios point to Brexit having a damaging impact on Scotland&rsquo;s economy and wider wellbeing. Nevertheless, short of maintaining full EU membership, we must stay in the Single Market and Customs Union.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Scottish Government will do all we can to protect trade and investment links with Europe and to provide the certainty that businesses want &ndash; which is why I would also encourage the UK and the EU to ensure that a transition deal is agreed at next week&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council."</p>

              <p>First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon and First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones have written to the House of Lords setting out why the Scottish and Welsh governments could not recommend consent to the EU Withdrawal Bill on the UK Government&rsquo;s amendments to clause 11.</p>
              <p>The two First Ministers also propose changes to the bill that they say would protect devolution. The Lords is due to consider aspects of the bill related to devolution on Monday.</p>
              <p>Full text of the letter below.</p>
              <p>Dear Lord Speaker</p>
              <p>We are writing further to our letter of 23 January in response to the letter from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to all peers dated 12 March about the amendments which have been tabled by the UK Government setting out its revised approach to clause 11 of the Bill.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government and the Welsh Government acknowledge that this represents a change of position but the amendments do not have their support.&nbsp; In this letter we set out our concerns about the amendments and proposals for changes to them.</p>
              <p>The UK Government amendments would provide a power to make regulations in devolved areas currently subject to EU law and would prevent the devolved legislatures from taking action in the areas covered in regulations.&nbsp; The UK Government say this is intended to be a temporary measure to provide certainty upon EU exit and to allow common frameworks to be put in place where it is agreed that these are necessary.</p>
              <p>Alongside the amendments the UK Government has published a list of 158 areas of intersection of devolved competence with EU law, noting that it envisages regulations temporarily restricting devolved legislatures&rsquo; competence (in advance of more substantive arrangements in primary legislation) in up to 24 of those areas. It should be noted these 24 areas &ndash; all of which apply to both Wales and Scotland &ndash; cover a very significant part of devolved responsibilities, including agricultural support, fisheries management, environmental policy, public procurement and food standards.</p>
              <p>These areas are of vital importance for the industries and economies of Scotland and Wales. The effect of the amendments now tabled in the House of Lords will be to allow the UK Government to make regulations in any or indeed all of these devolved areas &ndash; the 24 areas identified, or indeed the remaining 131 areas in its analysis. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government and the Welsh Government agree common frameworks are appropriate in some cases given the role of EU law in currently regulating action in all parts of the UK in these areas. But the devolved administrations and the devolved legislatures &ndash; whose legislative competence is being constrained - must agree any arrangements to &lsquo;freeze&rsquo; EU law pending the development of such frameworks. However, the UK Government amendment allows it to make regulations &ndash; and also further primary legislation to establish frameworks - in these and in any other area it deems appropriate without any involvement of the legislatures and merely after consulting the devolved administrations. In being asked to give legislative consent to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill on this basis, the devolved legislatures would be being asked to agree to the creation of this power with no certainty about where frameworks will be established, how these will work, how they will be governed and how we will go from temporary restrictions to longer term solutions.</p>
              <p>These shortcomings mean that the two Governments could not recommend consent to the amendment as it stands. They remain committed to working positively with the UK Government and propose the following changes to build on the position reflected in their current amendments:</p>
              <p>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further amendments to ensure that the temporary restriction of legislative competence in areas where new frameworks are intended to be created requires the consent of the devolved legislatures. This is in line with normal practice for legislation affecting devolved competence: amendments to competence, either by way of primary legislation or through Orders in Council under the Scotland Act 1998 or the Government of Wales Act 2006, must be the subject of devolved legislatures&rsquo; consent.</p>
              <p>II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further amendments to put beyond doubt that primary legislation to establish frameworks in these areas in the future (and release the restrictions on legislative competence) must be agreed by the devolved parliaments, as is normally the case under the Sewel convention for Westminster legislation relating to devolved matters. The effect of the UK proposal may well be to reserve those matters, meaning the devolved legislatures may have no say on such legislation.</p>
              <p>III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further amendments to ensure that any power to make regulations as a precursor to frameworks is temporary: similar &lsquo;sunset clauses&rsquo; are included in the case of other powers in the Bill which are temporary to allow laws to be updated in light of Brexit. There is no reason for this clause 11 power to stand as a permanent feature of the constitution when there are well established and successful legal mechanisms in place to adjust devolution.</p>
              <p>IV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further amendments to place a &lsquo;sunset clause&rsquo; on the restrictions of competence themselves. Whilst the two Governments accept that it may take time to put frameworks in place, regulations must not be open-ended and pressure to agree frameworks should apply to all parties. And while regulations restricting devolved legislatures&rsquo; competence remain in force, it should be a joint responsibility of the Secretary of State, the Scottish Ministers and the Welsh Ministers to prepare periodic reports and lay them before Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, explaining what progress is being made to remove those restrictions.</p>
              <p>The two Governments would be pleased to put forward detailed amendments if it proves impossible to reach agreement with the UK Government.</p>
              <p>The two Governments have also asked that the UK Government agree a level playing field and make a commitment not to bring forward legislation in respect of England in those areas where it is agreed common frameworks are to be established.</p>
              <p>We would be very grateful if this letter could, like the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&rsquo;s, be circulated to all Peers. We are copying it to the Leader of the House, the shadow Leader, the Convenor of the cross-bench peers and the Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, as well as to David Lidington, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Wales.</p>
              <p>Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones</p>

              <p>The analysis of responses to Transport Scotland&rsquo;s consultation &lsquo;Raising Standards and Improving the Quality of Road Works in Scotland&rsquo; has now been <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/publication/analysis-of-responses-from-the-consultation-march-2018-raising-standards-and-improving-the-quality-of-road-works-in-scotland/">published.</a></p>
              <p>The Scottish Government asked for views on proposals to raise standards, enhance enforcement, and provide additional powers for the Scottish Road Works Commissioner (SRWC). 88 responses were received which were largely supportive of the proposals in the consultation.</p>
              <p>Most agreed that there is already a great deal of good work being undertaken in the road works community, however, there is still remains room for improvement and innovation.</p>
              <p>There was clear support for measures designed to improve the quality of road works and to provide greater consistency between utility and roads authority road work sites. Almost all who responded agreed with measures designed to enhance and support the role of the Scottish Road Works Commissioner.</p>
              <p>Minister for Transport, Humza Yousaf, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am pleased that Scotland&rsquo;s road works community recognises the many strengths of our approach to the planning and coordination of road works. All road works across the entire country is covered by a single register and overseen by the Scottish Road Works Commissioner. We recognise that improvements can still be made and I am delighted that there is support for many of the recommendations from Jim Barton&rsquo;s independent review in 2016 of the Office and Functions of the SRWC.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This consultation will help inform the supporting legislation including elements of the Transport Bill announced by the First Minister within the Programme for Government. Putting quality first, we aim to improve the regulation of road works in Scotland, and to enhance and improve the role of the SRWC. I am committed to ensuring that any changes, including enhanced powers, reflect the views of our road works community and builds on the strong approach already in place.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The efficiency of our road networks is critical, and so too is the ability to undertake road works effectively, making necessary repairs while minimising disruption. This consultation has been an important step to towards our vision of improving road works in Scotland and I look forward to introducing legislation which will help deliver our proposals.&ldquo;</p>

              <p>A revised plan at one of Glasgow&rsquo;s key rail stations is set to yield significant economic and business opportunity for the city.</p>
              <p>Working in partnership with various stakeholders, Scottish Ministers have decided to progress a greatly enhanced development at the North Hanover Street car park site of Queen Street Station at an investment cost of around &pound;80 million.</p>
              <p>The new plans being taken forward include extensive retail, food and beverage opportunities, and will also deliver a development deck upon which further private sector investment can be taken forward.</p>
              <p>Humza Yousaf, Minister for Transport and the Islands said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The new proposal will help deliver a 21st century station acting as a catalyst for further private sector investment. Alongside the redevelopment of Queen Street station being delivered as part of the Edinburgh Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP) this will see a significant improvement to the overall passenger experience and deliver significant economic benefits to the city.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Alex Hynes, ScotRail Alliance managing director, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We look forward to working with the Scottish Government, and other commercial partners, on this ambitious vision for Queen Street. We&rsquo;re building the best railway Scotland has ever had and these plans will deliver an exciting new development for our customers and the people of Glasgow.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The station is currently being transformed to allow new longer, faster and greener electric trains to run on our railway and the plans announced today will help to ensure Queen Street continues to play a central role in the social and economic life of the city.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Councillor Susan Aitken, Leader of Glasgow City Council, said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The revised plans for Queen Street Station will deliver far greater local economic benefit, securing the full potential of the site and will provide significant employment opportunities once the development deck has been fully delivered. The redevelopment will both give the station a retail offer befitting one of Scotland&rsquo;s busiest transport hubs and provide a striking entry into the city for travellers coming to Glasgow.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Stuart Patrick, Chief Executive, Glasgow Chamber of Commerce</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We warmly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to progress the more ambitious scheme at Queen Street Station. The enhanced retail and leisure offer will improve the passenger experience, and provide more job creation opportunities for the city centre. It&rsquo;s accepted that Glasgow requires more Grade A offices, and the development deck will provide a desirable location for such investment in the heart of the city.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The new below-deck development will provide around 3,800 square metres for such facilities, in comparison to the 500 square metres (approx) which would have been provided by the partially constructed project. The layout of the retail, food and beverage outlets will be largely in accordance with previously consented plans.</p>
              <p>Projected rental income from the revised plan sees a potential increase from circa &pound;370k with the original proposal per annum to &pound;2.2 million - &pound;2.7 million per annum. The alternative development is pivotal to continued investment around Queen Street station and securing economic benefits to the city making Glasgow a more attractive place to visit and do business.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Works continue on redeveloping the main station building as part of the Edinburgh Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP) with the recent commencement of the main demolition works of Consort House which is needed to make space for the new Queen Street station frontage.</p>
              <p>The revised plan, whilst not part of EGIP, will have no detrimental impact on the delivery of the EGIP key milestones.</p>

              <p>Three-quarters of school heads believe the attainment gap has started to close and almost all expect progress in the next five years as a result of national attainment funding, new research has shown.</p>
              <p>An evaluation has been published on the first two years of the Attainment Scotland Fund, when &pound;52 million was targeted at schools in the most deprived areas.</p>
              <p>It found:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>78% of surveyed headteachers saw improvements in tackling the attainment gap in literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing as a result of the fund</li>
              <li>97% of surveyed headteachers expect to see improvements over the next five years as a result of the attainment funding</li>
              <li>Wide support for the aims of the fund, with schools reporting greater collaboration and a focus on improving teaching skills and practice</li>
              <li>Praise for the support provided by local authorities and Attainment Advisors in schools</li>
              <li>Challenges around the reporting requirements and timescales of the fund, staffing and the wider challenges of poverty and its impact on attainment</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary John Swinney said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The defining mission of this government is to raise school attainment and close the poverty-related gap, backed by &pound;750 million of investment over the lifetime of this Parliament.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is heartening to see that progress is beginning to be made. For example Dundee&rsquo;s attainment gap in reading narrowed between the first and second years of the fund. These are great results which show our course of action is the right one.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I acknowledge the challenges to progress that exist and have been identified by schools and local authorities. We have already taken action to address these and will continue to listen to feedback.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The Attainment Scotland Fund supports the aims of the <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/Schools/Raisingeducationalattainment/pupilequityfund">Scottish Attainment Challenge</a> which is to raise attainment and reduce inequity for children across Scotland.</p>
              <p>During the first two years of the fund, &pound;52 million was distributed to nine Challenge Authorities and 74 additional schools with the highest levels of deprivation.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2018/03/1892">interim evaluation report of the Attainment Scotland Fund</a> focuses on the first two years of the Attainment Scotland Fund (2015/16 and 2016/17). It does not include any evaluation of <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/Schools/Raisingeducationalattainment/pupilequityfund">Pupil Equity Funding</a>, which commenced in Year 3.</p>
              <p>The interim evaluation report aims to provide learning about the overall implementation of the fund, and the extent to which the aims of the fund have been met. More widely, it will contribute to the Scottish evidence base around what works or does not work to improve attainment and close the attainment gap.</p>

              <p>The initiative supporting action to combat climate change has helped in excess of 1,000 projects &ndash; and provided more than &pound;100 million funding over the past decade.</p>
              <p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the 1,000<sup>th</sup> recipient of the Climate Challenge Fund (CCF) as she announced the latest grants totalling &pound;15.3 million. That means total CCF funding since its launch in 2008 has now reached &pound;101 million, with 1,097 grants across Scotland.</p>
              <p>The 1,000<sup>th</sup> grant of &pound;290,392 was awarded to Glasgow-based Bike for Good for continuing their schools project &ndash; which works with young people, teachers and parents to encourage cycling and reduce car use.</p>
              <p>The 110 recipients in the 2018-2020 CCF, which is managed on behalf of the Scottish Government by Keep Scotland Beautiful, include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>&pound;143,333 for New Start Highland (Inverness): the project will create a hub to refurbish or upcycle unwanted and damaged furniture, bikes, textiles and clothing</li>
              <li>&pound;222,926 for Tagsa Uibhist (Benbecula): this Grow Your Own food project will develop existing school gardens and construct more community growing hubs</li>
              <li>&pound;183,744 for Gate Church (Dundee): reduce landfill waste by extending their collection box network, and launch a &lsquo;community fridge&rsquo; service to distribute unwanted food</li>
              <li>&pound;179,158 for the Next Step Initiative (Glasgow): help the Afro-Caribbean community tackle fuel poverty, with activities including a &lsquo;swap shop&rsquo; service for textile items</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The First Minister met Bike for Good staff, alongside pupils and teachers participating in the project from Wellshot Primary School in Glasgow. She said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Climate Challenge Fund enables communities to take ownership and action at a grassroots level, with projects that deliver tangible community and social benefits while helping address climate change.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;More than 1,000 projects have been supported by the CCF the length and breadth of Scotland, demonstrating the scope and scale of the fund. As I have seen for myself at Wellshot Primary, these fantastic projects are empowering local communities to make meaningful and lasting change.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Keep Scotland Beautiful Chief Executive Derek Robertson said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are delighted to be celebrating local action on climate change through the Climate Challenge Fund. In the Year of Young People, it is pleasing to see initiatives such as the Bike for Good project inspire pupils to take action on climate change through choosing to travel by bike.</p>
              <p>"Keep Scotland Beautiful and the Climate Challenge Fund have now helped more than 1,000 projects and&nbsp;look forward to supporting many more communities in the future &ndash;&nbsp;empowering them to help Scotland realise its carbon reduction ambitions.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Joanna Soraghan, Development Officer at Bike for Good, added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Climate Challenge Fund project has been a great success, involving upwards of 2,000 pupils across Glasgow so far in activities such as bike maintenance lessons, cycle skills training and route planning workshops to increase levels of active travel.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The enthusiasm of partners such as Wellshot Primary has played a significant part in the success of the project. We have been thrilled to work with the pupils and wider school community &ndash; all the while knowing we are reducing carbon emissions and making a positive environmental impact.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>People in the South of Scotland can help shape the agency being established to reinvigorate the area&rsquo;s economy.</p>
              <p>A Scottish Government consultation will seek the views of the local community and beyond on the shape of the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency.</p>
              <p>Launching the consultation, Economy Secretary Keith Brown announced it was &ldquo;a milestone moment for the future prosperity&rdquo; of the area.</p>
              <p>The Cabinet Secretary was speaking as he prepared to update the Scottish Parliament on the work of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership - the interim arrangement set up to deliver a fresh approach to economic growth in the area and pave the way for the new agency, with a &pound;10million funding boost for the region announced in the budget.</p>
              <p>Mr Brown added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The consultation will ask the people, businesses and the voluntary sector across the South of Scotland what would make this agency work for them.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We have set out our overarching vision for the Agency that drives inclusive growth across the area.&nbsp; We now want people to help shape the detail of the activity the Agency can take forward to deliver those aims.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This is a tremendous opportunity to transform the area&rsquo;s economy, building on its significant strengths and traditions. And the launch of this consultation is a milestone moment for the future prosperity of the region.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The South of Scotland is a beautiful area and has played a long and important part in the history of the Scottish economy. It nurtured Scotland&rsquo;s textile industry, its agriculture and forestry sectors are thriving, and it has a growing tourism industry.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It has a diverse business base, many of which are small and family owned. The economic seeds are all there and, with the right nurturing, can flourish.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/economic-policy-unit/new-enterprise-agency-for-the-south-of-scotland">consultation</a> opens today (March 15) and will close on 7 June.</p>
              <p>Responses to the consultation will help inform the legislation to establish the agency and help shape its structure. A report summarising the outcome of the consultation will be published in July.</p>
              <p>South of Scotland Economic Partnership chair Professor Russell Griggs added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are ambitious for the South of Scotland. The Scottish Government has made a positive commitment to the area and today&rsquo;s consultation launch takes us a step closer to the Agency we need.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We want to make sure that people across the South of Scotland take this opportunity to shape their future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Over the next few months we will be out and about meeting communities and businesses to hear about what matters to them and what the new agency can do to support them.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>BACKGROUND</p>
              <p>The South of Scotland Economic Partnership was <a href="https://news.gov.scot/news/gbp-10m-boost-for-south-of-scotland">launched</a> in January.</p>

              <p>A disability adviser has been appointed to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s expert panel on dealing with disposable items such as single use cups and plastic straws.</p>
              <p>Kate Sang, Professor of Gender and Employment Studies and Disability Co-ordinator at Heriot Watt University, will advise the panel on equalities issues and lived experience, and on the potential implications for disabled people of the group&rsquo;s proposals.</p>
              <p>The panel has been formed to consider environmental charging and other measures that could be introduced in Scotland to tackle our throwaway culture.</p>
              <p>Professor Sang will bring expertise in equalities issues and lived experience to help shape policy and provide advice on the implications for disabled people of the group&rsquo;s proposals.</p>
              <p>Announcing the appointment, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I would like to warmly welcome Professor Sang to the role. Her expertise will be vital in shaping our policy and creating environmentally-friendly ways to encourage long-term, sustainable changes in consumer and producer behaviour in Scotland.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Professor Sang will advise the panel on issues that will or could have an impact on disabled people. One such issue is how we identify ways to reduce plastic waste such as single-use plastic straws, whilst ensuring that people who depend upon them are not disadvantaged. Professor Sang&rsquo;s expertise and experience will be invaluable.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Professor Sang said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I am delighted to have the opportunity to support the work of the expert panel.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I look forward to working with the panel to ensure that disability issues are considered alongside technical matters to sustainable solutions, for example, to the production and use of single use plastics. In addition to my own experiences as a disabled person, I hope to bring my research with disabled people to the recommendations of the panel, ensuring that the work is sensitive the variety of needs of disabled people in a way which supports the aims of the panel.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Ms Cunningham will appoint further members of the panel in coming weeks. Among the first items to be considered will be disposable cups and plastic straws.</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The 2017/18 Programme for Government <em>A Nation With Ambition</em> stated that:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We will appoint an expert panel to advise on the use of charges, similar to the successful plastic bag charge, with the goal of encouraging long-term and sustainable changes in consumer behaviour.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>In the Year of Young People, primary and secondary school kids and students have been at the forefront of developing content for an <a href="http://www.whereverly.com/"><strong>exciting new tourism phone app</strong></a> to help visitors explore the hidden treasures of the A9.</p>
              <p>Over 100 school children from Pitlochry High School choir recorded traditional Scottish songs. In addition, Napier University students and graduate engineers from the three consultancies and joint ventures designing the A9 Dualling programme were involved in producing the content for the app.</p>
              <p>The Highland Discovery app, which is being introduced as a result of the A9 Dualling programme, provides information on small, community facilities and businesses along the A9 and also includes an in-car audio channel offering Scottish stories and songs.</p>
              <p>The app goes live today on both Android and Iphones having already been trialled last year in Beta mode when it was downloaded 500 times and nearly 20% of users came from overseas.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the Scottish Storytelling Centre in Edinburgh where he met two of the storytellers featured on the app and young people who helped develop the content for it,&nbsp;Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The work to dual the A9 between Perth and Inverness is progressing at pace with draft Orders now published for six of the eleven projects with more to come this year. Later this year work will start on the next section to be dualled between Luncarty and Pass of Birnam. We remain on target to complete this ambitious programme by 2025.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;However, the A9 Dualling programme is about more than building a road. We also want to take the opportunity to improve the visitor experience for people travelling along the A9. This exciting new Highland Discovery app will help anyone visiting the area explore some of the hidden treasures that are on or near this iconic road and get a glimpse into the local culture of Scotland with stories and music.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;When the app was piloted last year it was downloaded 500 times, twenty per cent of these were from people overseas. An encouraging start and now that it is available to both Android and Iphone users I expect the uptake to increase.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It is fitting that in this Year of Young People, local school children and students working on the dualling programme have played such an important role in developing the content for this app for visitors travelling on this route which links the central belt with the Highlands and Islands.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland Chief Executive, added:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The A9 is much more than just a road. It connects visitors to some of the best tourism experiences in Scotland, taking them through the heart of Perthshire and up to the Highlands. Scotland&rsquo;s reputation as a quality destination relies on innovation and considering new and creative ways to reach out to visitors, showcasing all we have to offer.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Highland Discovery app is an excellent example of that, highlighting the hidden gems and renowned attractions that lie just off the A9 corridor. It&rsquo;s also fitting that the visitors of tomorrow - our young people - have helped develop the content. The Year of Young People is all about celebrating the talents and contributions of Scotland&rsquo;s young people and creating new opportunities for them to shine.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.whereverly.com/"><strong>Highland Discovery tourism app</strong></a>, downloadable on&nbsp;ios or android formats,&nbsp;is the outcome of developing technology to help all of Scotland&rsquo;s rural communities to maximise the economic potential of tourism, no matter how remote they are.</p>
              <p>The app creates an in-car audio experience, which allows tourists to make connections with the passing landscape, history and culture of Scotland.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Farmers, crofters and land managers are being urged to submit their Single Application Form (SAF) online.</p>
              <p>This year&rsquo;s SAF window, where applicants submit claims for support under the Common Agricultural Policy&rsquo;s (CAP) Pillar 1 and 2 schemes, is now open and runs until midnight on 15 May 2018.</p>
              <p>Rural Secretary Fergus Ewing said:</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I would encourage everyone who wishes to do so to submit their Single Application Form online as soon as possible and not wait until the last moment.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Although we will still accept paper applications, the online system is specifically designed to simplify the process by automatically checking applications for errors &ndash; reducing the risk of financial penalties. Indeed more than three quarters of farmers and crofters benefited from submitting their SAF online last year, allowing for their application to be validated straightaway.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Support is being offered to farmers, crofters and land managers who wish to make the switch to applying online &ndash; a move I would encourage everyone to consider.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>The Single Application Form (SAF) allows the Scottish Government's Rural Payments and Inspections Division (RPID) to administer Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) support. It is the form that farmers and crofters must submit to claim payments under a number of different schemes.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Government will still accept paper applications and we will send a paper application to those customers who have made contact with us making clear that they still choose to apply that way. For further information about applying, farmers, crofters and land managers should contact their local area office.</p>
              <p>If you are using the <a href="https://www.ruralpayments.org">Single Application Form</a> ( <a href="https://www.ruralpayments.org">https://www.ruralpayments.org</a> ) to apply for CAP payments, farmers, crofters and land managers should make sure that they are familiar with the latest guidance for <a href="https://www.ruralpayments.org/publicsite/futures/topics/all-schemes/basic-payment-scheme/basic-payment-scheme-full-guidance/greening-guidance-2018/">Greening</a> and <a href="https://www.ruralpayments.org/publicsite/futures/topics/inspections/all-inspections/cross-compliance/">Cross Compliance</a>.</p>

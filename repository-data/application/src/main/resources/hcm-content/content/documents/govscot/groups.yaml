        hippostd:content: "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p>Citizens expect public\
          \ services to be available digitally. Digital transformation means changing\
          \ the way an organisation works. To transform, there may be changes to an\
          \ organisation's:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>culture</li> \n   <li>processes</li>\
          \ \n   <li>technology</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The Central Government Digital\
          \ Transformation Service (CGDTS) works collaboratively with organisations\
          \ to enable business transformation for improved public services.</p> \n\
          \  <p>This work includes:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>building digital strategies</li>\
          \ \n   <li>business cases</li> \n   <li>designing technology platforms building\
          \ digital skills</li> \n   <li>digital maturity models</li> \n  </ul> \n\

          >Digital Maturity Model (DMM)</h3> \n  <p>High level explanation of what\
          \ digital maturity is? The DMM provides a benchmark of the digital maturity\
          \ of an organisation. This is established by checking digital capability\
          \ in five key areas: · Customer Focus · Collaboration &amp; Value For Money\
          \ · Data – Openness &amp; Privacy · Skills &amp; Capability · Strategy &amp;\
          \ Leadership</p> \n  <p>To do this, DTS carry out the following activities:\
          \ · A facilitated workshop where participants are asked a series of questions\
          \ to rate their organisation's digital maturity · Key elements of the discussion\
          \ and the scores are captured by DTS to inform the report</p> \n  <p>It\
          \ is a way to bench mark where your organisation is before creating aDigital\
          \ Strategy.</p> \n  <p>NB: How Digital are you? See Deloitte &amp; online\
          \ survey: <a href=\"https://eu.deloittedigital.com/en/content/digital-maturity\"\

          \ \n  <p>Outputs</p> \n  <p>A point in time report of the organisation's\
          \ 'As Is' Digital State detailing??? Is the below a clearer way to explain\
          \ this?</p> \n  <p>A report capturing what the organisation's digital capability\
          \ is by using the following tools – be good to give a quick explanation\
          \ of SWOT or link to information that does explain: · Overall maturity scoring\
          \ · Scoring per principle · SWOT Analysis, detailed findings and additional\
          \ relevant information · Benefits to clients With the report the organisation\
          \ can: · Assess digital capability against established standards · Start\
          \ to determine the digital direction of travel and desired outcomes ? ·\
          \ Understand high-level pressing needs and quick wins · Start to inform\
          \ a Digital Strategy and roadmap for improvement</p> \n  <p>3.2 Value Chain\
          \ Mapping</p> \n  <p>Explain what value chain mapping is first Value Chain\
          \ Mapping offers a process and practice to gain genuine insights into an\
          \ organisation and the environment in which it operates?? Needs to be clearer.</p>\
          \ \n  <p>The exercise usually takes place before a strategy is devised or\
          \ when there is a desire to revise the current strategy.</p> \n  <p>Activities\
          \ This exercise is usually split into stages: · A facilitated workshop with\
          \ relevant stakeholders · An initial basic map after the collection of initial\
          \ data illustrating participants and functions · Adjusted mapping, which\
          \ is conducted following additional and follow-on interviews. · Having completed\
          \ both stages of the Value Chain Mapping process, DTS are able to map the\
          \ components and dependencies of a service Outputs · Value Chain Maps (can\
          \ we use an image to demonstrate) · High-level analysis &amp; recommendations\
          \ Benefits to clients · Gives an organisation situational awareness and\
          \ a better sense of how they function · Better understanding of organisational\
          \ risks · Helps to identify skill gaps · Helps organisations understand\
          \ patterns in their sector · Feeds contextual analysis as part of a Digital\
          \ Strategy ??</p> \n  <p>3.3 User Research User research focuses on understanding\
          \ user behaviours, needs, and motivations. These are collected by using\
          \ observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies.</p>\
          \ \n  <p>Activities · Senior Team Orientation · User Research Alignment\
          \ Workshop · Co-design Workshop · User Journey Mapping · Contextual Interviews</p>\
          \ \n  <p>Outputs The outputs of the activities will vary according to what\
          \ has been executed and the outcomes.</p> \n  <p>Benefits to clients · Identifies\
          \ main user groups and new audiences · Identifies possible user barriers\
          \ to using the service · Enhanced user experience leads to better engagement\
          \ · Informs service design</p> \n  <p>3.4 Process Mapping Business Process\
          \ Modelling develops visual aids which help understand and document how\
          \ an organisation works?. An example would make this clearer These take\
          \ two forms: 1) 'As-is' models which will help identify how effectively\
          \ and efficiently an organisation is currently working and where incremental\
          \ improvements can be obtained 2) 'To-be' models design the activities that\
          \ will determine how new or changed services will be managed within the\
          \ organisation.</p> \n  <p>'To-be' models will usually be accompanied by\
          \ significant business, policy or ICT changes. Activities · Iterative??\
          \ workshops with an organisation's staff – not sure you mean iterative here?\
          \ · Business Analysts work with staff to explorework processes gently probe\
          \ to elicit further information as required</p> \n  <p>Outputs Visual aids\
          \ to understand the organisation include – explanation, link to information\
          \ or an example needed for the below: · Swim lane diagrams · Context diagrams\
          \ · Data flow diagram · Process Flow · Cross skilling of basic notation\
          \ skills for staff involved?</p> \n  <p>It will also provide a gap analysis\
          \ and document quick wins for \"as-is\" models and resource requirements\
          \ for \"to-be\" models.</p> \n  <p>During the process modelling it is not\
          \ unusual to identify organisational risks that are not currently on the\
          \ organisation's risk register.</p> \n  <p>Benefits to clients · Gain insights\
          \ into how effectively or efficiently it is operating · Decide which quick\
          \ wins to implement · Create efficiencies due to implementation of quick\
          \ wins · Create a change schedule for longer term changes · Understand how\
          \ new services will be delivered and the resource model required to support\
          \ them · Use the models as effective training tools · Register any new risks\
          \ in the risk register and create a risk management plan</p> \n  <p>3.5\
          \ Technical Survey</p> \n  <p>A Technical Survey gathers and analyses information\
          \ about the digital and ICT architecture currently operating within an organisation.\
          \ The scope of the survey will typically include applications, information/data\
          \ and technology architecture. It may also include some business architecture\
          \ artefacts linked to other Discovery activities.</p> \n  <p>The scope of\
          \ the survey can be tailored to consider subsets of the architecture that\
          \ are of specific interest for example XXX The Architecture Survey also\
          \ considers the principles used to set the digital/ICT direction/policy\
          \ and considers risks existing in the current architecture.</p> \n  <p>At\
          \ the conclusion of the project, the organisation will receive guidance\
          \ which will cover some/all of the following: · Identify key risks existing\
          \ in the current architecture and suggest possible changes · Make suggestions\
          \ to improve the productivity and cost-effectiveness of the current architecture\
          \ · Consider the technical governance process and make suggestions about\
          \ how this may be improved and give advice about SG digital strategy and\
          \ policy (e.g. Digital First Service Standard) · Assess how well the current\
          \ solutions support the provision of Digital Public Services and again make\
          \ suggestions on possible next steps</p> \n  <p>Activities - explanations\
          \ about the following</p> \n  <p>· Architecture Principles Review · Application\
          \ Catalogue · Information/Data Catalogue · Technology Catalogue · Key Solution\
          \ Quality Assessment · Architecture RAID Log</p> \n  <p>Outputs</p> \n \
          \ <p>There are two levels of output.:</p> \n  <ol> \n   <li><p>A high level\
          \ or Lightweight Architecture Survey which usually gives a small number\
          \ of key solutions</p> </li> \n   <li><p>A more comprehensive Architecture\
          \ Survey report that offers different technical solutions which support\
          \ the delivery of services to a lower level</p> </li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Benefits\
          \ to clients – all of the below needs plain englished · Provides a view\
          \ of alignment of architecture to the organisation's business/digital/ICT\
          \ strategies and wider Scottish Government guidance. · Gives evidence-based\
          \ snapshot of the Information &amp; Communication Technology (ICT) status\
          \ including an overview of the Business, Application, Data &amp; Technology\
          \ Architecture · Includes an overview of in-flight ICT programmes to ensure\
          \ systems support current/future services · Identification and management\
          \ of architecture and technical risks · Provides input into a Digital Strategy\
          \ and acts as a starting point for an Architecture Roadmap to plan Digital\
          \ Transformation</p> \n  <p>3.6 Digital Strategy A Digital Strategy is best\
          \ described as 'a plan for maximising the business benefits of data assets\
          \ and technology-focused initiatives'. Is it really? Is that not quite a\
          \ narrow definition of what a digital strategy is and confusing for non\
          \ tech folk? A digital strategy aligns an organisation's digital vision,\
          \ objectives &amp; activities . A user-centred Digital Strategy will enable\
          \ the organisation to deliver services more efficiently and successfully.\
          \ The services offered by DTS during the Discovery? Why is Discovery thrown\
          \ in here – Discovery hasn't been mentioned anywhere. Do you mean the services\
          \ offered before creating a digital strategy? are critical to give a view\
          \ of the current state of the organisation. This, aligned to a horizon scan,\
          \ will form the basis of the strategy. The Digital Strategy will generate\
          \ high-level activities and a roadmap will show the key activities your\
          \ organisation wants to do and when it wants to do them .. Activities ·\
          \ Current State Analysis · Horizon Scan · Digital Vision · Objectives &amp;\
          \ Benefits · Establish Design and Technology Principles · High-level activities\
          \ &amp; Roadmap</p> \n  <p>Outputs It is recommended that the strategy itself\
          \ is a lightweight document that is clear and easily understood. The approach\
          \ and materials to support the strategy may be added in the appendices or\
          \ in a separate document.</p> \n  <p>Benefits to clients<br>· Creates a\
          \ living document which is co-authored with the organisation · Provides\
          \ a clear roadmap to transformation · Frames the delivery activities</p>\
          \ \n  <p>3.7 Business Case High-level activities as identified in a strategy\
          \ will often require an outline or full Business Case which DTS can support\
          \ or develop. For example…</p> \n  <p>Business cases should be developed\
          \ over time. It is an iterative process and at each key stage further details\
          \ are added. The three key stages are strategy, outline business case and\
          \ Full Business Case. The Business Case can be presented in various forms\
          \ ranging from a well-structured written document to a visual presentation.</p>\
          \ \n  <p>A compelling business casecaptures the quantifiable and non-quantifiable\
          \ characteristics of a project. In most cases, there is great scope for\
          \ opportunity should the Business Case be successful. ?? Activities · Full\
          \ Business Case · Outline Business Case · Agile Business Case</p> \n  <p>Tools</p>\
          \ \n  <p>· Background and drivers · Business options analysis and recommended\

          \ and Recruitment The DTS recruitment &amp; Talent offer provides a specialist,\
          \ tailored but flexible service driven by customer requirements. We aim\
          \ to support our customers in recruitingand developing digital talent, by\

          \ Design Embedding user focussed service design into your organisation's\
          \ DNA needs a strategic approach across the organisation. Service design\
          \ is everyone's business.</p> \n  <p>The Scottish Approach to Service Design\
          \ Champions Programme is designed to be taken by a group of staff who represent\
          \ key areas and grades within your organisation. Some will be working in\
          \ digital areas, some will not be. Digital service transformation is business\
          \ transformation - user focussed service design needs to embrace all of\
          \ the organisation's business activities.</p> \n  <p>Activities</p> \n \
          \ <p>Over three months, participants have 4 full day sessions of group learning,\
          \ 2 one-to-one coaching sessions, and work based learning tied to live projects\
          \ in their organisation.</p> \n  <p>The programme is supported by a 'toolkit'\
          \ for use in future activities, session notes and a guided reading list.\
          \ Outputs By the end of the course participants will be able to: · Understand\
          \ and be able to communicate the value of the Scottish Approach to Service\
          \ Design · Act as champions for user focussed service design thinking in\
          \ their areas · Understand the key stages, methods and tools of user focussed\
          \ service design · Help shape and/or manage user research and service design\
          \ procurements ·<br>Benefits to clients · Re-designs services with users\
          \ at the centre · Ensures that services are designed to be delivered with\
          \ efficiency and within capacity · Increases user satisfaction with services\
          \ and increases conversion to digital services </p> \n  <p>3.10 Agile Coaching</p>\
          \ \n  <p>An explanation of what agile is first? In Agile Coaching, an experienced\
          \ coach observes the team to understand what attitudes, practices and communication\
          \ problems are keeping them from being more effective. Throughout the process,\

          \ has been convened to explore the challenge of ensuring the safety of electrical\
          \ installations. In addressing the challenge, the Scottish Government is\
          \ committed to three key outcomes:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>protecting consumers</li>\
          \ \n   <li>protecting scrupulous traders and creating an inhospitable environment\
          \ for miscreants</li> \n   <li>maintaining an environment that allows competition\
          \ within the provision of electrical services to thrive</li> \n  </ul> \n\
          \  <p>One proposal to achieve these objectives is to provide title protection\
          \ for electricians. Other proposals include a voluntary regulation scheme,\
          \ and an increased emphasis on increasing consumer awareness and making\
          \ it easier to identify qualified professionals.</p> \n  <p>The Scottish\
          \ Government is committed to finding a way forward on the basis of clear\
          \ evidence, and on the understanding that any solution must be proportionate\
          \ and have a demonstrable ability to achieve our stated outcomes. These\
          \ parameters will underpin any Scottish Government action, and we hope that\
          \ the Working Group will provide a forum for solutions to be explored through\
          \ thorough and open discussion.</p> \n </body>\n</html>"

          \ and following ministerial approval, communicate and oversee the implementation\
          \ of a 3 year cyclical commissioning plan that supports the 10 year strategy\
          \ with the first commissioned services to be in place by the start of the\

          \ efficiency</li> \n   <li>attitudes and behaviour in relation to energy\

          \  </ul> \n  <p>This work helped to inform our consultation on an energy\
          \ efficiency standard in the private rented sector. </p> \n  <p>In this\
          \ consultation we proposed that all private rented homes should have to\
          \ meet a minimum energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of E: </p>\
          \ \n  <ul> \n   <li>at a change in tenancy after 1 April 2019</li> \n  \
          \ <li>in all private rented properties by 31 March 2022</li> \n  </ul> \n\
          \  <p>We also proposed that this standard should be increased, so that all\

          >Energy efficiency and condition standards in private rented housing consultation</a>\
          \ sought views on how a standard would work, how it would be enforced, and\
          \ whether there are some situations where the owner would not be expected\
          \ to bring the property up to standard. The consultation closed on 30 June\
          \ 2017. We appointed contractors to analyse the 198 responses and we published\
          \ the <a href=\"https://beta.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficiency-condition-standards-private-rented-housing-analysis-responses-public/pages/2/\"\
          >analysis report</a> on 14 November.</p> \n  <p>We are considering the responses\
          \ to the consultation, and will confirm the minimum standards for the private\
          \ rented sector alongside the wider ambitions of Scotland's Energy Efficiency\
          \ Programme (SEEP) as part of the launch of the SEEP routemap in May 2018.\
          \ This will include the proposed timescale for introducing minimum standards,\
          \ as well as setting out wider elements of SEEP.</p> \n  <p>Subject to the\
          \ outcome of this consultation, Ministers will hold a second, shorter consultation\
          \ on the proposed regulations allowing for a lead-in time to the start of\
          \ any standard. </p> \n  <p>We plan to consult on proposals to increase\

          \ development on the collaborative economy</li> \n   <li>to make recommendations\
          \ to Scottish Ministers on how Scotland can position itself to take advantage\
          \ of the opportunities of the collaborative economy and overcome any regulatory,\
          \ economic and social challenges</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>In conjunction with\
          \ the Scottish Government, the panel has identified that the key considerations\
          \ are how to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>ensure that regulation is fit for purpose\
          \ and that an appropriate balance is struck to allow competition to flourish;</li>\
          \ \n   <li>protect and empower consumers and identify clear routes to redress;</li>\
          \ \n   <li>develop digital leadership skills to enable Scotland's business\
          \ base to digitally transform and compete in the evolving market place;</li>\
          \ \n   <li>prepare Scotland's current and future workforce for the digital\
          \ workplace by ensuring they can access courses to gain or update skills;\
          \ and</li> \n   <li>ensure that the wider economic, social and community\
          \ impacts, including taxation, social inclusion and employment conditions\
          \ are taken into account and embedded into the final recommendations.</li>\
          \ \n  </ul> \n  <h3 id=\"call-for-evidence\">Call for evidence</h3> \n \
          \ <p>To help inform the work of the panel a call for evidence was open between\
          \ 24 April – 29 May. The <a href=\"https://beta.gov.scot/publications/scottish-expert-advisory-panel-collaborative-economy-call-evidence/\"\

          \ 2019. These are intended to achieve the social security and carer outcomes,\
          \ particularly that carers: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>feel they are treated\
          \ with dignity and respect</li> \n   <li>can easily access help and advice\

          \ a range of carer support.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The experience of young\
          \ carers will drive our work. We will proactively ensure that diversity\
          \ and equality issues are addressed to enable us to embody dignity and respect.\
          \ The work of the group may be supported by short term working groups on\
          \ specific issues.</p> \n </body>\n</html>"

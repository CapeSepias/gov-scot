          hippostd:content: "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p>An independent\
            \ review of the regulation of legal services was announced by Minister\
            \ of Community Safety and Legal Affairs, Annabelle Ewing in April 2017.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>The purpose of the review is to make recommendations to reform\
            \ and modernise the framework for the regulation of legal services and\
            \ complaints handling. </p> \n  <p>The aim is to promote consumer interests\
            \ and a flourishing legal sector, and includes ensuring that consumers\
            \ properly understand the options open to them when something goes wrong\
            \ and that the regulatory framework is proportionate for legal firms.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>The review, which is being chaired by NHS 24 chair Esther Robertson,\
            \ is expected to consult widely with stakeholders and report to Scottish\
            \ Ministers by the end of 2018.</p> \n  <p>Regulations may be required\
            \ to make further provision on complaints made about approved regulators,\
            \ and these may be expected in 2018</p> \n  <hr> \n  <p>The Legal Services\
            \ (Scotland) Act 2010 (\"the Act\") removes restrictions which previously\
            \ prevented solicitors entering into business relationships with non-solicitors,\
            \ allowing both investment by non-solicitors and non-solicitors. Solicitors\
            \ and/or other regulated professionals i.e. non-solicitor professionals\
            \ such as accountants will require to hold at least a 51% majority stake\
            \ in the business.</p> \n  <p> It is anticipated that the introduction\
            \ of alternative business structures to the legal services market will\
            \ provide clients with a wider access to legal services and they will\
            \ be able to expect the same standards of service, advice and consumer\
            \ protection </p> \n  <p>Bespoke regulatory schemes are required for these\
            \ businesses and the 2010 Act allows for up to three regulators to offer\
            \ regulatory schemes to such businesses. The 2010 Act requires such regulators\
            \ to be approved by Scottish Ministers with the agreement of the Lord\
            \ President.</p> \n  <p>The Act creates a tiered regulatory framework\
            \ for the new business entities, licenced providers, which provide legal\
            \ services for a fee, gain or reward under a licence issued by an approved\
            \ regulatory. This framework will operate as follows: </p> \n  <ol> \n\
            \   <li>Scottish Ministers will license and regulate approved regulators.</li>\
            \ \n   <li>Approved regulators will in turn license and regulate licensed\
            \ providers. </li> \n   <li>A licensed provider will have obligations\
            \ to manage and oversee people in the entity â including lawyers, other\
            \ professionals and non-professionals â in a way which is compatible with\
            \ the regulatory regime imposed by the approved regulator.</li> \n  </ol>\
            \ \n  <p>Under the Act, a professional or other body can become an approved\
            \ regulator by a two-stage process. The first stage is to obtain approval\
            \ and the second to obtain authorisation both by application to the Scottish\
            \ Ministers. If an application for approval is granted, then this means\
            \ that the body can now call itself an approved regulator. It is only\
            \ after successfully being granted an application for authorisation that\
            \ the approved regulator can regulate its licensed providers.</p> \n \
            \ <p>It is the responsibility of the approved regulator to create and\
            \ implement a regulatory scheme for its licensed providers. This must\
            \ include details about three sets of rules: </p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Licensing\
            \ rules: relating to the application process and the issuing or renewal\
            \ of licences. </li> \n   <li>Practice rules: governing how licensed providers\
            \ operate. </li> \n   <li>Compensation rules: governing the arrangements\
            \ for compensating the clients of licensed providers for financial loss\
            \ resulting from the dishonesty of the licensed provider or someone in\
            \ it. </li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>The scheme is regulation of licensed providers\
            \ as entities â individuals within the entities who are regulated by professional\
            \ bodies will continue to be so regulated by them. For example, solicitors\
            \ will be regulated by the Law Society of Scotland.</p> \n  <p>The Law\
            \ Society of Scotland submitted an application to Scottish Ministers on\
            \ 16 December 2015 to become an approved regulator of licensed legal services\
            \ providers, under the 2010 Act. Scottish Ministers wrote to the Law Society\
            \ of Scotland on 17 January 2017 approving them as an approved regulator\
            \ of licensed legal services providers, as the first part of a two stage\

            \ aquaculture fish health to reduce the risk of loss because of disease.\
            \ Our veterinarians and fish health experts are committed to high quality\
            \ research and development, and sharing disease risk management information.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>Surveillance and monitoring helps to make sure emerging\
            \ fish health issues are detected quickly, and that there is a timely\
            \ and appropriate response when potential disease risks are found. </p>\
            \ \n  <h2 id=\"surveillance-programme\">Surveillance Programme</h2> \n\
            \  <p>We have developed a risk-based surveillance model to help minimise\
            \ the risks of introducing and transmitting diseases at Scottish aquaculture\
            \ facilities. Our scheme is also designed to improve detection of increased\
            \ mortality at farm sites. It combines site visits with passive and intelligence-led\
            \ surveillance. </p> \n  <p>Under Council Directive 2006/88/EC as interpreted\
            \ under current regulation (The Aquatic Animal Health (Scotland) Regulations\
            \ 2009), there is a requirement for regular inspections, visits and audits\
            \ of aquaculture production businesses, and authorised processing establishments.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>Our Fish Health Inspectors are responsible for fish and\
            \ shellfish disease surveillance in Scotland. This includes detecting\
            \ increased mortality, and carrying out a surveillance scheme at all sites\
            \ operated by authorised aquaculture production businesses (APBs), in\
            \ all farming areas. The frequency of site inspection depends on the zone's\
            \ health status, and the outcome of a risk assessment of each site within\
            \ that zone. </p> \n  <h2 id=\"risk-based-surveillance\">Risk Based Surveillance</h2>\
            \ \n  <p>The risk factors that determine the frequency of surveillance\
            \ of farms are the: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>direct spread of disease via\
            \ water </li> \n   <li>movements of aquaculture animals </li> \n   <li>type\
            \ of production </li> \n   <li>species kept (are they susceptible?) </li>\
            \ \n   <li>bio-security system, staff competence and training </li> \n\
            \   <li>density of farms and processing establishments in the area </li>\
            \ \n   <li>proximity of farms with lower health status to the farm in\
            \ question </li> \n   <li>health status track record of farms in the area\
            \ </li> \n   <li>presence of disease pathogens in wild aquatic animals\
            \ </li> \n   <li>risk posed by human activity, predators or birds </li>\
            \ \n  </ul> \n  <p>As well as being risk-based, the surveillance model\
            \ is supported by diagnostic investigations involving sampling and targeted\
            \ surveillance. These focus on proving disease freedom as part of surveillance\
            \ agreed with the European Commission and SCoFCAH (Standing Committee\
            \ on the Food Chain and Animal Health (UK)). The UK is currently free\
            \ of diseases exotic to the EU. The UK is also considered free of most\
            \ non-exotic listed diseases after presentating evidence from targeted\
            \ surveillance. </p> \n  <p>The scheme also includes: intelligence-led\
            \ surveillance, training awareness and, importantly, work to raise the\
            \ effectiveness of passive surveillance. This type of surveillance is\
            \ an early response to information from industry and health experts in\
            \ the course of their site surveillance work. There is also provision\
            \ for unannounced site visits. </p> \n  <p><strong>Listed diseases, Scotland's\

            \ includes aspects of sea lice assessment - within the provisions of the\
            \ Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Acts of 2007 &amp; 2013. A separate\
            \ site risk ranking has been developed to enable fish health inspectors\
            \ to carry out sea lice enhanced inspections based on the following factors:\
            \ </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>synchronous fallowing </li> \n   <li>historic\
            \ lice problems in the previous four years </li> \n   <li>following code\

            \ agreement </li> \n   <li>treatment discharge in place </li> \n  </ul>\
            \ \n  <p>Sites are ranked low, medium or high risk to enable the appropriate\
            \ scheduling of assessments. The Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation\
            \ Fish Health Management Reports are also being considered a useful tool\
            \ in assessing risk ranks in relation to scheduled visits. </p> \n  <p><strong>Frequency\
            \ of surveillance:</strong> </p> \n  <p>Scotland's health status, and\
            \ the site risk rank, determines the surveillance frequency of routine\
            \ inspections undertaken by the Fish Health Inspectorate. Fish farm sites\
            \ classed as highest surveillance frequency are visited at least once\
            \ a year, those ranked medium are visited at least every second year and\
            \ those ranked low are visited at least every third year. This results\
            \ in an annual total of around 251 site inspections, depending on the\
            \ number of farms operated by aquaculture production businesses (APBs)\
            \ each year. </p> \n  <h2 id=\"disease-management-areas\">Disease Management\
            \ Areas</h2> \n  <p>Disease Management Areas are based on separation distances\
            \ around active farms,. They take into account tidal excursions and other\
            \ epidemiological risk factors. Farms with overlapping separation distances\
            \ will usually be within the same disease management area. </p> \n  <p><a\

          <p>The culture and heritage budget helps to improve quality of life in Scotland&#39;s communities by enabling and encouraging people from all walks of life to participate in cultural events and opportunities. It also supports a wide range of government commitments relating to culture and heritage. </p>
          <p>The culture and heritage budget for 2016 to 2017 is Â£154.1 million. </p>
          <h3 id="world-heritage-sites">World Heritage Sites</h3>
          <p>When the UK signed the United Nations&#39; World Heritage Convention, we promised to identify places in Scotland which could be World Heritage Sites, and to protect our national heritage. There are currently six World Heritage Sites in Scotland: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>St Kilda </li>
          <li>Old and New Towns of Edinburgh </li>
          <li>Heart of Neolithic Orkney </li>
          <li>New Lanark </li>
          <li>Frontiers of the Roman Empire: the Antonine Wall </li>
          <li>The Forth Bridge </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Scottish Ministers have to report to the UK Government on any issues for Scotlandâs World Heritage Sites. Each site is managed by a group of local partners, which include local authorities and Historic Environment Scotland. As the lead body for the historic environment in Scotland, Historic Environment Scotland is responsible for advising Ministers on these issues. </p>

          <p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2003/8/contents">Building (Scotland) Act 2003</a> is the primary legislation under which Scotland&#39;s building standards system operates.</p>
          <p>One of its functions is to give ministers power to make secondary legislation to support the Act. You can find this on the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/secondary?title=Building%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%202003">UK legislation website</a>. </p>

            >A low carbon building standards strategy for Scotland (The Sullivan Report)</h3>\
            \ \n  <p>In 2007 Ministers convened an expert panel to create '<a href=\"\
            /publications/a-low-carbon-strategy-scotland-sullivan-report/\">A low-carbon\
            \ building standards strategy for Scotland (The Sullivan Report)</a>'.\
            \ This set out recommendations to drive forward standards and innovation.\
            \ They included the delivery of very low-carbon buildings through building\
            \ regulations, in support of climate change objectives. It provided an\
            \ overall route map towards 'net zero carbon' new buildings and was a\
            \ key part of subsequent reviews of energy standards in 2010 and 2015.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>In May 2013, ministers asked the panel to revisit some of\
            \ the original recommendations. Their findings are published in the report\
            \ '<a href=\"/publications/low-carbon-building-standards-strategy-scotland-sullivan-report-2013-update/\"\
            >A low carbon building standards strategy for Scotland â 2013 update</a>'.</p>\
            \ \n  <h3 id=\"sustainability-labelling\">Sustainability labelling</h3>\
            \ \n  <p>A sustainability label must be provided for any building where\
            \ section 7 of the technical handbooks apply. We produce <a href=\"/publications/building-standards-technical-handbook-2017-domestic/\"\

            \ appropriate label for your property using our <a href=\"http://www.s7sust.co.uk/\"\

          hippostd:content: "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p>Scotland's children's\
            \ hearings system takes an integrated and holistic approach to care and\
            \ justice, in which the child's best interests are the paramount consideration.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>It is built upon principles established by the Kilbrandon Report\
            \ of 1964, the main one being that children and young people who offend,\
            \ as well as those who require care and protection, should equally be\
            \ considered 'children in need'. </p> \n  <p>The children's hearings system\
            \ has since been modernised and strengthened by further legislation, the\
            \ most recent being the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2011/1/contents\"\
            >Children's Hearings (Scotland) Act 2011</a> (the 2011 Act), which came\
            \ into effect on 24 June 2013.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"administration\">Administration</h3>\
            \ \n  <p>Scotland's children's hearings system is administered through\
            \ two non-departmental, government-funded public bodies:</p> \n  <ul>\
            \ \n   <li>the <a href=\"http://www.scra.gov.uk/\">Scottish Children's\
            \ Reporter Administration (SCRA)</a>, formed under the Local Government\
            \ (Scotland) Act 1994</li> \n   <li><a href=\"http://www.chscotland.gov.uk/\"\
            >Children's Hearings Scotland (CHS)</a>, formed under the Children's Hearings\
            \ (Scotland) Act 2011</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Both SCRA and CHS are governed\
            \ by a board of non-executive members that is accountable to Scottish\
            \ Ministers and the Scottish Parliament.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"updates-made-by-the-2011-act\"\
            >Updates made by the 2011 Act</h3> \n  <p>The 2011 Act:</p> \n  <ul> \n\
            \   <li>created the role of National Convener to act as a figurehead for\
            \ panel members</li> \n   <li>created CHS to support the National Convener\
            \ in the recruitment, selection, training, retention and support of panel\
            \ members</li> \n   <li>replaced local authority panels with a national\
            \ children's panel, with area support teams to support panel members at\
            \ a local level</li> \n   <li>created a national Safeguarder panel to\
            \ improve consistency and standards, and to improve understanding of the\
            \ role within the standards</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The 2011 Act strengthens\
            \ children's rights within the children's hearings system by:</p> \n \
            \ <ul> \n   <li>providing for the development of an advocacy service specifically\
            \ for children in the hearings system</li> \n   <li>amending the Rehabilitation\
            \ of Offenders Act to ensure that offence grounds accepted or established\
            \ in children's hearings (except for certain serious offences) are no\
            \ longer classed as a conviction</li> \n   <li>giving children's hearings\
            \ the power to withhold information from a person if it could put a child\
            \ at risk</li> \n   <li>taking steps to ensure that hearings take children's\
            \ views into account</li> \n   <li>introducing a legal representation\
            \ scheme to be run by the Scottish Legal Aid Board that replaces local\
            \ authority administered arrangements, to ensure justice for those who\
            \ need help but can't afford it</li> \n   <li>introducing transparency\
            \ to the decision-making process around placement into secure accommodation</li>\
            \ \n   <li>introducing a feedback loop to permit information sharing about\
            \ compulsory supervision orders</li> \n   <li>modernising the reasons\
            \ (grounds) for referral</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h3 id=\"safeguarders\">Safeguarders</h3>\
            \ \n  <p>Children's hearings and sheriffs appoint Safeguarders where they\
            \ think there is a requirement to safeguard the interests of the child\
            \ involved. The Safeguarder does an independent assessment of what is\
            \ in the child's best interests, and provides it to the hearing or court.</p>\

          <p>We introduced a programme of reform to the structures and processes of Scotlandâs justice system following a 2009 independent review of Scotlandâs civil courts.</p>
          <p>The review, by Lord Gill, now the Lord President of the Court of Session, found that the system was âslow, inefficient and expensiveâ, and made a number of recommendations.</p>
          <p>We <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2010/11/09114610/0">responded to the review</a> in November 2010, and accepted the majority of Lord Gillâs recommendations, including:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>establishing a Civil Justice Council for Scotland</li>
          <li>a new national Sheriff Appeal Court and Personal Injury Court</li>
          <li>modernisation of civil court procedures</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The 2012 Strategy for Justice in Scotland set out our approach to make the Scottish justice system fit for the 21st century. </p>
          <p>We published Justice in Scotland: vision and priorities in 2017. It builds on the outcomes set out in the 2012 strategy.</p>

          <p>To empower communities in Scotland, we are: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>funding community-led regeneration through the <a href="/policies/community-empowerment/empowering-communities-fund/">Empowering Communities Fund</a></li>
          <li>funding <a href="/policies/community-empowerment/participatory-budgeting/">participatory budgeting</a> through the Â£1.5 million Community Choices Fund, giving people more power to make decisions on spending in their local areas </li>
          <li>making it easier for communities to take over land and buildings in public ownership through <a href="/policies/community-empowerment/asset-transfer/">asset transfer</a> </li>
          <li>supporting <a href="/policies/community-empowerment/community-councils/">community councils</a> to represent communities&#39; opinions and needs to public bodies </li>
          <li>giving communities the ability to request to participate in decisions and processes which are aimed at improving outcomes through <a href="/policies/community-empowerment/participation-requests/">participation requests</a> </li>
          <li>setting out best practise for public bodies to engage with communities via the <a href="http://www.voicescotland.org.uk/Seven-NS/">National Standards for Community Engagement</a> </li>
          <li>providing guidance on <a href="/policies/community-empowerment/common-good-property/">common good property</a></li>
          <li>launching the <a href="/policies/improving-public-services/local-governance-review/">Local Governance Review</a>, a comprehensive review of how local decisions are made and how local democracy is working</li>
          <li>supporting public service providers to work together and with local communities via <a href="/policies/improving-public-services/community-planning/">community planning</a> to shape and deliver better services  </li>
          </ul>

        govscot:background: |+
          <p>Research has shown that when communities feel empowered, there is: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>greater participation in local democracy</li>
          <li>increased confidence and skills among local people</li>
          <li>more people volunteering in their communities</li>
          <li>greater satisfaction with quality of life in the neighbourhood </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Better community engagement and participation leads to the delivery of better, more responsive services and better outcomes for communities. </p>
          <p>In 2015 Parliament passed the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2015/6">Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015</a> to give new rights to community bodies and new duties to public sector authorities. To explain further, we have published: </p>

            \ needs of island areas were taken into account, and the particular nature\

          <p>In Scotland, responsibility for issues that affect disabled people are split between issues reserved to the UK Government, and areas that we are responsible for. </p>
          <p>We are responsible for most public services including: local councils, education, housing, social work and the NHS in Scotland. </p>
          <p>The UK Government is responsible for equality legislation including the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">Equality Act 2010</a>, the <a href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/">Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)</a>, employment, income and some benefits. </p>
          <p>We make equality considerations part of our everyday work. Find out more about: <a href="/publications/scottish-governments-equality-duties/">mainstreaming equality</a>.</p>
          <p>Statistics and research evidence on disability are crucial in helping us identify issues that need to be addressed. More information on the range of evidence we use is available on <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/Equality/Equalities/DataGrid/Disability">the disability pages of the Equality evidence finder</a>. </p>

            \ in Scotland to 1,140 hours.</p> \n  <p>We used the responses to develop\

            \ is ensuring a high-quality experience for all children. This requires\
            \ a dedicated, skilled and well-qualified workforce. </p> \n  <p>To this\

            \ an updated version later in 2017 alongside the Quality Action Plan.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>We are also working with the Care Inspectorate and other\

            \ for childminders delivering the ELC entitlement to be qualified to the\
            \ same level as ELC practitioners. We will work with stakeholders to define\
            \ standards for providers of the nationally funded ELC provision. </p>\
            \ \n  <h4 id=\"equal-opportunities\">Equal opportunities</h4> \n  <p>We\

            \ in disadvantaged areas get an additional graduate or teacher from 2018.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>To ensure all children are able to access their ELC entitlement,\
            \ we are creating a fund for specialist training, equipment and adaptations\

          </ul>

        govscot:background: |+
          <h4 id="eia-background">EIA background</h4>
          <p>The requirement for EIA comes from <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:026:0001:0021:EN:PDF">European Directive 2011/92/EU</a>. The Directive was brought into Scottish law through a number of Scottish Statutory Instruments relevant to individual consenting regimes: Town and Country Planning, Forestry, Energy, Trunk Roads, and Agriculture.</p>
          <p>The update to this Directive, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1400054241343&amp;uri=CELEX:32014L0052">Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (2014/52/EU)</a>, came into force on 15 May 2014. Member states had to apply these rules from 16 May 2017 at the latest.</p>
          <h4 id="hra-background">HRA background</h4>
          <p>HRA stems from the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1012/contents/made">Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017</a>, which require the relevant plan authority to undertake an &#39;appropriate assessment&#39; of plans that are likely to have an adverse effect on a &#39;Natura 2000&#39; site.</p>
          <p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/index_en.htm">Natura 2000</a> is the Europe-wide network of protected sites developed under the European Commission Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC) and the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC). </p>
          <p>The process for determining whether an appropriate assessment is required, together with the appropriate assessment itself (where necessary) is known as the Habitats Regulations Appraisal.</p>
          <h4 id="sea-background">SEA background</h4>
          <p>The Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005 extended SEA legislation beyond the requirements of the original Directive, so that in Scotland every qualifying public plan, programme and strategy is assessed for its likely environmental effects and, where likely to be significant, opportunities are sought to avoid adverse impacts and enhance positive ones. </p>
          <p>The findings of the Environmental Assessment must be set out within a public consultation to ensure that those with an interest, or likely to be affected by the plan, are able to understand the environmental implications and offered an opportunity to have their views taken into account.</p>

          <h4 id="leaving-the-eu">Leaving the EU</h4>
          <p>In the 2016 referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU, 62% of voters in Scotland voted for the UK to remain, with all 32 local authority areas in Scotland returning remain majorities. However 52% of voters across the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU.</p>
          <p>While accepting the UK Government&#39;s decision to leave the EU, we are committed to ensuring Scotland&#39;s interests in Europe are understood and protected throughout the Brexit negotiations. </p>
          <p>For more than 40 years individuals, businesses and communities across Scotland have experienced the social, economic and cultural benefits of EU membership. They include the freedom to live, study, work, trade or travel across the 28 member states.</p>
          <p>In addition, Scotland has become home to 209,000 non-UK EU citizens. We recognise that they bring valuable skills to the workplace, play an important role in local communities, and help support economic growth. </p>
          <p>The EU has also provided social protection for all people in Scotland, guaranteeing minimum working conditions and the right to not be discriminated against on the basis of gender, race, nationality or age.</p>
          <p>Our proposals in light of the referendum are outlined in the paper <a href="/publications/scotlands-place-europe/">Scotland&#39;s Place in Europe</a>. </p>

            \ solution which will enable Scotland to remain within the single market\
            \ while the rest of the UK leaves </li> \n   <li>ensuring that powers\

            \ current devolution settlement, to safeguard Scotland's interests within\

            \ to protect the rights of EU citizens in Scotland and of Scots living\
            \ elsewhere in the EU. We want Scotland to remain a welcoming and outward-looking\
            \ country, and recognise that EU citizens play a vital role in supporting\
            \ our economy and growing our population. </p> \n  <p>The white paper\

            \ 19 June 2017 with an opening day of talks to agree the sequence, format\
            \ and rhythm of those negotiations. </p> \n  <p>The first full round of\
            \ phase one UK-EU negotiations began in the week commencing 17 July, and\

            \  <p>Once phase one of negotiations has concluded, the UK Government\

            \ of the future UK-EU partnership, alongside any continued negotiation\
            \ on phase one issues. Phase two will begin only when the EU27 (the other\
            \ 27 countries of the EU) is satisfied that sufficient progress has been\

            \ to provide a means for devolved administrations to be fully engaged\

            \ asked the UK Government to clarify the involvement of the devolved administrations\
            \ in the UK-EU negotiations. </p> \n  <p>On 29 March 2017 (the date of\
            \ the Article 50 notification), David Davis responded to these requests\
            \ in a letter to Michael Russell MSP, Minister for UK Negotiations on\
            \ Scotland's Place In Europe. The letter stressed that the shape of negotiations\
            \ was unknown, but reiterated a commitment to close engagement. </p> \n\

            \ the EU. </p> \n  <p>By updating the Nordic Baltic Policy Statement,\

            \ \n  <p>The Nordic Baltic countries share many similarities with Scotland.\
            \ Geographically, we are on the periphery of mainland Europe, with similar\
            \ demographics and broadly similar topographies in many regions. This\
            \ means that our communities and businesses face similar challenges, and\
            \ that we can benefit from learning how these other countries are working\
            \ to provide solutions.</p> \n  <p>Similarly, the Nordic Baltic countries\
            \ are established world leaders in areas such as marine affairs, energy\
            \ and innovation, and social welfare. Scotland is making progress in many\
            \ of the same areas, and we see engagement with these countries as an\
            \ opportunity to promote our work in these areas further.</p> \n </body>\n\

          <h4 id="process">Process</h4>
          <p>We distribute the ESIFs to lead partners through Strategic Interventions (SIs): large-scale allocations of more than â¬15 million, structured around specific themes and with specific aims. Lead partners are policy directorates, agencies and local authorities with the capacity and capability to manage the funds and provide match funding of their own to increase the overall levels of investment. </p>
          <p>We work with lead partners to divide the SI and match funding into smaller amounts known as Operations. Individual projects and organisations then apply to lead partners to access the funds, and awards are made to projects most likely to achieve the stated aims of the SI. </p>
          <p>We work with the lead partners to ensure the funds are awarded, monitored and evaluated in accordance with ESIF regulations. </p>
          <h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
          <p>The ESIFs are intended to achieve EU priorities in areas such as employment, innovation, education, poverty reduction and climate change/renewable energy. </p>
          <p>They align with our priorities for Scotland, of reducing poverty and social exclusion, boosting educational attainment and skills development, growing employment levels, economic activity and innovation, and addressing climate change through increased use of renewable energy.</p>
          <p>More information on the ESIFs can be found on the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/contracts_grants/funds_en.htm">European Commission website</a>.</p>

            \ and eat each day. In this vision: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>it is the norm\
            \ for Scots to take a keen interest in their food, to know what constitutes\
            \ good food, and to seek it out whenever they can </li> \n   <li>people\
            \ who serve and sell food â including schools, hospitals, retailers, cafes\
            \ and restaurants â are committed to serving and selling good food </li>\
            \ \n   <li>everyone in Scotland has access to the healthy and nutritious\
            \ food they need </li> \n   <li>dietary-related diseases and the environmental\
            \ impact of our food consumption are in decline </li> \n   <li>Scottish\
            \ producers ensure that what they produce is increasingly healthy and\
            \ environmentally sound </li> \n   <li>food companies are a thriving feature\
            \ of the economy and places where people want to work </li> \n   <li>other\
            \ countries look to Scotland to learn how to become a 'Good Food Nation'\
            \ </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>We created the <a href=\"food-commission\">Food\

          <li>the <a href="/policies/economic-growth/enterprise-and-skills-review/">Enterprise and Skills Review</a>, which is improving support for students, workers and businesses</li>

          <p>Since publishing our first Economic Strategy in 2007, our central purpose has been to create a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth. </p>
          <p>Achieving this has remained the focus of each subsequent economic strategy. </p>
          <p>The Economic Strategy is complemented by:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the tri-annual <a href="/publications/state-of-the-economy-november-2017/">State of the Economy report</a> in which the <a href="/about/how-government-is-run/directorates/chief-economist-office/">Chief Economist</a> provides a picture of the Scottish economy in the context of the UK and international economies</li>
          <li>the annual <a href="/publications/nation-ambition-governments-programme-scotland-2017-18/">Programme for Government</a>, which sets out our plan for policy delivery and legislation over the next year </li>
          </ul>

            \ First Minister announced an end-to-end review to ensure that our public\
            \ agencies are delivering sufficient enterprise and skills support for\
            \ Scotland's young people, universities, colleges, training providers,\
            \ businesses and workers.</p> \n  <p>The Enterprise and Skills Review\
            \ is being led by the Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work,\
            \ and supported by a Ministerial Review Group. </p> \n  <p>The Review's\
            \ aims are to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>significantly improve enterprise\
            \ and skills support, to help Scotland progress towards achieving our\
            \ aim of ranking among the top quartile of OECD countries in terms of\
            \ productivity, equality, wellbeing and sustainability</li> \n   <li>be\
            \ driven by evidence, to listen to the views of service users, and to\
            \ put forward proposals that respond to their needs</li> \n   <li>ensure\
            \ a simpler and more coherent enterprise and skills support system</li>\
            \ \n  </ul> \n  <h3 id=\"phase-1-call-for-evidence\">Phase 1: call for\
            \ evidence</h3> \n  <p>A call for evidence attracted 329 submissions from\

            \ Skills Review: report on Phase 1</a> published in October 2016.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>This report contained 10 recommendations focused on ensuring\
            \ coherence and a simpler, more flexible and cost-effective system of\
            \ national and local support.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"phase-2-projects\">Phase\
            \ 2: projects</h3> \n  <p>Phase 2 commenced in November 2016 with the\
            \ start-up of nine projects to take forward the Phase 1 recommendations.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>Ongoing engagement with key stakeholders â particularly from\
            \ the business community â is central to the process of all these projects\

            \ \n  <p>Key actions set out in the Phase 2 report include:</p> \n  <ul>\
            \ \n   <li>creating a new Strategic Board to support the coâordination\
            \ of agency activities around shared priorities, and to drive improved\
            \ performance</li> \n   <li>creating a new enterprise agency for the South\
            \ of Scotland, to meet the distinct economic needs of the region and its\
            \ communities</li> \n   <li>developing a more coherent, collaborative\
            \ and streamlined system of business support, with a single digital access\
            \ point</li> \n   <li>piloting a Â£500,000 College Innovation Fund to support\

          <p>Under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/26/contents">Housing (Scotland) Act 1987</a> a person should be treated as homeless, even if they have accommodation, if it would not be reasonable for them to continue to stay in it. </p>
          <p>Councils have a legal duty to help people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. They do this by: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>providing information and advice </li>
          <li>offering temporary or permanent accommodation if circumstances warrant it </li>

          <p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2001/10/contents">Housing (Scotland) Act 2001</a> introduced changes to existing homelessness legislation. It established the right to review a homelessness decision, and introduced a duty on registered social landlords (RSLs) to assist local authorities in rehousing homeless people.</p>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2003/10/contents">Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003</a> outlined the provision that by 2012 anyone finding themselves homeless through no fault of their own must be entitled to settled accommodation (a council or housing association tenancy or private rental). </p>
          <p>This amended the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/26/contents">Housing (Scotland) Act 1987</a> which defines the rights of homeless people and was enshrined in law in 2012 with the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2012/330/contents/made">Homeless (Abolition of Priority Need Test) (Scotland) Order 2012</a>.

            \ those assessed as unintentionally homeless will be entitled to settled\
            \ accommodation as a legal right'. </p> \n  <p>We created the Scottish\
            \ Housing Options funding programme to help councils make the necessary\
            \ changes, which included establishing five regional knowledge sharing\

          <p>Human rights is a subject devolved to Scotland by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/contents">Scotland Act 1998</a>. The Scottish Parliament also has competence to observe and implement international human rights treaties. We work within that legal framework. </p>
          <p>In Scotland, civil and political rights are protected by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents">Human Rights Act 1998</a> and provisions in the Scotland Act 1998. These rights come from the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</a>.</p>
          <p>Other rights are also recognised under international treaties which apply to Scotland. These are mainly economic, social and cultural rights. They include rights relating to employment, housing, health, education and adequate standards of living. </p>
          <p>The European Union also guarantees the rights of people in Scotland in areas where EU law applies. These laws cover civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. </p>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.gov.scot/About/People/14944/684">Scottish Ministerial Code</a> is clear that Ministers must comply with the law, including international law and human rights treaty obligations.</p>

        govscot:billsAndLegislation: |+
          <p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents">Human Rights Act 1998</a> incorporated the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</a> into UK law. It means that public organisations, such as the government, councils and the police, must protect and abide by human rights. If human rights have been breached, cases can be taken to UK courts.</p>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/contents">Scotland Act 1998</a> ensures that laws passed by the Scottish Parliament can be challenged and overturned by the courts if they are not compatible with rights identified in the ECHR. Scottish Government Ministers have &#39;no power to act&#39; in a way that breaches these ECHR rights.</p>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2006/16/contents">Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006</a> created the <a href="http://scottishhumanrights.com/">Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC)</a>. The SHRC is an independent public body that promotes and protects the human rights of everyone in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Scotland&#39;s approach to human rights is also governed by international law. This has developed since the United Nations adopted the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/UDHRIndex.aspx">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> in 1948. Seven major UN human rights treaties, along with eight Council of Europe human rights treaties, currently apply to Scotland.</p>

        govscot:background: |+
          <p>In 2010 we established an independent Commission chaired by Dr. Campbell Christie CBE to develop recommendations for the future delivery of public services. The <a href="/publications/commission-future-delivery-public-services/">report from the Christie commission on the future delivery of public services</a> was published in June 2011.</p>
          <p>In September 2011 we published <a href="/publications/renewing-scotlands-public-services-priorities-reform-response-christie-commission/">Renewing Scotland&#39;s public services: priorities for reform in response to the Christie Commission</a>. </p>
          <p>In our response we stated our expectation for public services to work with each other and with communities to deliver services which recognise the importance of people, prevention, performance and partnership.</p>
          <p>We expect our public services to work with each other and with communities to deliver services that are underpinned by the following principles:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>subsidiarity and local decision making: decisions should be taken at the lowest possible level or at the level closest to the people they affect</li>
          <li>simple, open democracy: people should be able to influence decisions that affect them and their families, and trust the decisions made on their behalf by those they elect</li>
          <li>personal and empowering: people should have equal opportunity to participate and have their voice heard in decisions shaping their local community and society</li>
          <li>fairness and equality of outcomes: arrangements should be appropriate and tailored towards the needs and aspirations of people and places, to support the delivery of shared national outcomes</li>
          <li>financially sustainable and preventative: arrangements should be effective, efficient and represent value for money for Scotland as a whole</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Reform is supported by advances in digital technology, greater integration, effective partnerships, and the expectation that all services will work collaboratively to address the problems facing people and communities which cannot be meaningfully and effectively tackled by one organisation working alone.</p>

        govscot:billsAndLegislation: |+
          <p>In 2015 we introduced the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2015/6">Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015</a> to give community bodies new rights and public sector authorities new duties, to strengthen the voices of communities in the decisions that matter to them. </p>

            \ set out the importance of empowering communities, large or small, to\
            \ make more decisions for themselves. Our ambition is to place much greater\
            \ control in the hands of the people who know best what a community needs:\
            \ those who live or work in the community itself.</p> \n  <p>On 7 December\
            \ 2017 the Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities,\
            \ together with Cllr. Alison Evison, President of COSLA, launched the\
            \ Local Governance Review. This process will involve everyone with an\
            \ interest in an inclusive dialogue on the future of local democracy in\
            \ Scotland. </p> \n  <p>The review brings a wide range of Scotland's public\
            \ services into scope. This will include some of those powers and functions\
            \ held at national level. We will work closely with the public, private\
            \ and third sectors to explore what changes to decision-making arrangements\
            \ can improve people's lives in different places across Scotland. However,\
            \ the most important test of every change that is proposed will be what\
            \ citizens themselves want to see happen. </p> \n  <p>The Review will\
            \ hear as many different voices as possible by bringing the conversation\
            \ out into local communities. The engagement process will run throughout\
            \ 2018 with people's views being used to inform new legislation that will\
            \ be introduced within the lifetime of this parliament.</p> \n  <p>Anyone\
            \ who has ideas about how to open up the conversation as far and wide\
            \ as possible, or about the type of changes they think should be part\
            \ of the discussion, should contact the Local Governance Review team at\

            \ to design and deliver better services that make a real difference to\
            \ people's lives.</p> \n  <p>It drives public service reform by bringing\
            \ together local public services with the communities they serve, and\
            \ provides a focus for partnership working that targets specific local\
            \ circumstances. Partners work together to improve local services and\
            \ to ensure that they meet the needs of local people, especially those\
            \ who need the services most.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"community-planning-partnerships\"\
            >Community Planning Partnerships</h3> \n  <p>A Community Planning Partnership\
            \ (or CPP) is the name given to all those services that come together\
            \ to take part in community planning. There are 32 CPPs across Scotland,\
            \ one for each council area. Each CPP focuses on where partners' collective\
            \ efforts and resources can add the most value to their local communities,\
            \ with particular emphasis on reducing inequality.</p> \n  <h4 id=\"cpp-plans\"\
            >CPP plans</h4> \n  <p>CPPs are responsible for producing two types of\
            \ plan to describe their local priorities and planned improvements:</p>\
            \ \n  <ul> \n   <li>Local Outcomes Improvement Plans, which cover the\
            \ whole council area</li> \n   <li>Locality Plans, which cover smaller\
            \ areas within the CPP area, usually focusing on areas that will benefit\
            \ most from improvement. Each CPP will produce at least one Locality Plan\
            \ and some CPPs will produce many â there is no fixed number</li> \n \
            \ </ul> \n  <h4 id=\"community-participation\">Community participation</h4>\
            \ \n  <p>Community participation lies at the heart of community planning,\
            \ and applies in the development, design and delivery of plans as well\
            \ as in their review, revision and reporting. Consultation is no longer\
            \ enough - CPPs and community planning partners must act to secure the\
            \ participation of communities throughout. </p> \n  <p>CPPs should organise\
            \ themselves in whatever way they think will help them to work well. As\
            \ part of this, they should make sure that everyone involved is clear\
            \ about what they have agreed to do and who is responsible for doing what.\

          <p>Since 2005 we have committed at least Â£3 million per year toward funding international development work. This was initially focused on Malawi, to reflect 150 years of collaborative development between out two countries. </p>
          <p>From 2007 our work and budget expanded, with Â£9 million for projects in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In 2017 we increased our IDF to Â£10 million a year, and continued to support more initiatives alongside it. </p>
          <p>All of our international development work now contributes to sustainable development and the fight against poverty, injustice and inequality internationally, within the framework of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
          <h3 id="united-nations-sustainable-development-goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</h3>
          <p>In July 2015 the First Minister announced Scotland&#39;s intention to sign up for the United Nation&#39;s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are the globally agreed priorities for tackling poverty and inequality in UN member states up until 2030. </p>
          <p>In 2016, as we reached the 10th anniversary of our international development programme, we ran the consultation, <a href="https://consult.scotland.gov.uk/international-development-team/meeting-global-challenges/">Meeting global challenges and making a difference - aligning our international development policy with the global goals</a>. Its purpose was to develop an updated policy that: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>would deliver on our commitment to the SDGs </li>
          <li>was in line with good development practice </li>
          <li>would focus our IDF and other related work to where it could make a real difference, and the biggest impact in relation to our budget </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="global-citizenship-scotland-s-international-development-strategy">Global Citizenship: Scotland&#39;s International Development Strategy</h3>
          <p>In December 2016 we published <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/global-citizenship-scotlands-international-development-strategy/">Global Citizenship: Scotland&#39;s International Development Strategy</a> which sets out our contribution to the international community. </p>
          <p>The strategy aligns with other policies that include Scotland&#39;s International Framework, the Scottish National Action Plan on Human Rights, Education Scotland&#39;s International Strategy, the Trade and Investment Strategy, and the Internationalising Social Enterprise Strategy.</p>

            \ Emergency Fund (HEF) from spring 2017. Its purpose is to provide immediate\
            \ and effective assistance to reduce the threat to life and wellbeing\
            \ of a large number of a population caused by disasters, disease or conflict.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>We have established an expert HEF Panel comprising eight\

            >Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) secretariat</a> to support the HEF\

            \ first funding released from the HEF, which was allocated to the East\
            \ Africa crisis. The funding, split between the DEC Appeal and non-DEC\

            \ and seeking to go beyond that by identifying other government policies\
            \ which can contribute positively to development outcomes and impact;\
            \ and promoting the Beyond Aid agenda outside of government. </li> \n\
            \  </ul> \n  <h3 id=\"fair-trade\">Fair trade</h3> \n  <p>Since 2010 we\
            \ have provided core funding to the Scottish Fair Trade Forum to promote\
            \ fair trade in Scotland, with the aim of achieving and then maintaining\
            \ Fair Trade Nation status. </p> \n  <p>Scotland achieved Fairtrade Nation\
            \ status in 2013 after meeting a range of criteria to demonstrate that\
            \ we are contributing to reducing poverty, improving the lives of people\
            \ that we seek to support, and helping them to access their rights. </p>\
            \ \n  <p>The achievement of Fair Trade Nation status for Scotland, first\
            \ in February 2013 and once more in March 2017, signals to the world that\
            \ Scotland takes an active leadership role in challenging global poverty\
            \ and recognising the dignity and rights of producers, through a commitment\
            \ to fairness in international trading. </p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://beta.gov.scot/publications/fair-trade-nation-criteria/\"\

            \ shaping our international development work through the lens of the \"\
            Beyond Aid\" agenda. This agenda recognises that development assistance\
            \ and other initiatives funded under our IDF and CJF are one part of international\
            \ development work, and that some of the greater benefits to the world's\
            \ poorest and most vulnerable can be brought about through policy changes.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>Within government, we have put policy coherence for development\
            \ (PCD) at the heart of this new approach. PCD means working across government\
            \ policy areas, and with global partners, to face the challenges and maximise\
            \ the impact on developing countries of all Scotland's actions (for example,\
            \ our climate change targets): firstly through a \"do no harm\" approach,\
            \ and secondly through positive development contributions by other policy\
            \ areas (for example, Hydro Nation). </p> \n  <p>Outside of government,\
            \ we will promote the Beyond Aid agenda and seek to encourage others to\
            \ make good and fair choices with regard to the impact of their actions\
            \ on sustainable development and on developing countries. </p> \n </body>\n\

        govscot:background: |+
          <p>Scotlandâs system of land ownership, use, rights and responsibilities has evolved over time in a way that does not always enable everyone to benefit. We decided to review how land is owned, used and managed in Scotland to ensure that everyone in Scotland can benefit from it. </p>
          <p>In 2012 we commissioned an independent review of land reform which took evidence from more than 400 people, communities and organisations. The Land Reform Review Group published its report, <a href="/publications/land-reform-review-group-final-report-land-scotland-common-good/">The land of Scotland and the common good</a>, in May 2014. </p>
          <p>We welcomed the overall findings of the report and committed to bringing forward a Land Reform Bill within the Parliamentary term. We <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/land-reform-and-tenancy-unit/land-reform-scotland">consulted on the future of land reform in Scotland</a> between December 2014 and February 2015 to gather views on the proposed legislation. </p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament in June 2014 and given royal assent on 24 July 2015. The Act addressed a number of recommendations in the Land Reform Review Group&#39;s report. </p>
          <p>The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament in June 2015, and given royal assent on 22 April 2016. </p>
          <p>In April 2017 we set up the <a href="https://landcommission.gov.scot/">Scottish Land Commission</a> as a new statutory public body to engage with the public and advise ministers on land reform. </p>
          <p>On 28 September 2017 the Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, Roseanna Cunningham, launched the <a href="/publications/scottish-land-rights-responsibilities-statement/">Scottish land rights and responsibilities statement</a>.</p>

            \ Ministers and passed initial checks to ensure compliance, we forward\
            \ it to the landowner and any heritable creditor for their comments. A\
            \ temporary Prohibition is placed on the landowner or creditor preventing\
            \ them from taking steps to transfer or dispose of the land. Ministers\
            \ will consider any comments submitted when deciding whether to approve\
            \ or reject the application. </p> \n  <p>If the application is approved,\
            \ the registration will remain over the land for five years with the chance\

            \ \n  <h4 id=\"re-registration\">Re-registration</h4> \n  <p>An application\
            \ can be extended by a further five years by applying to ministers to\
            \ re-register interest within six months of the expiry date. The process\

            >Register of Community Interest in Land</h4> \n  <p>The Land Reform (Scotland)\
            \ Act 2003 stipulated that the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland (RoS)\
            \ should set up and maintain a <a href=\"http://rcil.ros.gov.uk/RCIL/default.asp?category=rcil&amp;service=home\"\
            >Register of Community Interests in Land (RCIL)</a>. </p> \n  <p>The RCIL\
            \ allows anyone to see all community body applications, their supporting\
            \ documents and their status. Some documents may not be included on the\
            \ RCIL due to data protection laws, but can be requested from the Community\
            \ Land Team. </p> \n  <h3 id=\"right-to-buy-process\">Right to buy process</h3>\
            \ \n  <p>The right to buy can only be activated when the landowner has\
            \ indicated that the registered land is to be transferred, or when the\
            \ provisions of the Act are breached. </p> \n  <p>If the right to buy\
            \ is activated and the community body decides to proceed, we take the\
            \ group through the right to buy process. As part of this, ministers will\
            \ appoint and pay for an independent valuer to determine the market value\
            \ of the land. </p> \n  <p>Following the valuation, ministers will appoint\
            \ and pay for a ballotter to ballot the defined community. The results\
            \ will form part of the right to buy application, along with any evidence\
            \ provided to support the proposals, such as a business plan or feasibility\
            \ study.</p> \n  <p>Should ministers give consent to proceed with the\
            \ right to buy, the community body will have eight months from the date\
            \ they confirmed they wished to proceed (or longer if agreed between both\
            \ parties) to conclude the transfer of the land.</p> \n </body>\n</html>"

            \ have the skills they need to live and work in an increasingly global\
            \ society.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"the-1-2-approach\">The 1+2 approach</h3> \n\
            \  <p>In response to <a href=\"/publications/language-learning-scotland-12-approach/\"\
            >recommendations from the Languages Working Group</a> we have pledged\
            \ to enable and encourage every child to learn two languages in addition\
            \ to their native tongue â the 1+2 approach. </p> \n  <p>By 2021, every\
            \ school in Scotland will offer children the opportunity to learn a first\
            \ additional language from primary one, and a second additional language\
            \ by primary five. It is expected that this will continue until they reach\
            \ their third year of secondary education.</p> \n  <p>Schools and local\
            \ authorities will decide which additional languages are taught. We will\
            \ encourage parents to work with their childrens' schools to explore ways\
            \ of enriching the language learning experience.</p> \n  <h4 id=\"support-for-implementing-1-2\"\
            >Support for implementing 1+2</h4> \n  <p>We aim to implement this policy\
            \ by 2021 and are giving local authorities significant extra funding to\
            \ help them to deliver it. As of April 2017 we have given them an additional\
            \ Â£24.2 million to fulfil this task.</p> \n  <p>We are working in partnership\
            \ with <a href=\"https://education.gov.scot/\">Education Scotland</a>\
            \ to ensure that parents, teachers and others with an interest in language\
            \ learning have access to advice and support that will help them to understand\
            \ and implement 1+2.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.scilt.org.uk/\">Scotland's\
            \ National Centre for Languages</a>, known as SCILT, offer complementary\

            >Benefits of learning additional languages</h3> \n  <p>We believe it is\
            \ important for Scotland that our young people are attracted to learning\
            \ languages, so that they are well equipped for life and work in the ever-changing\
            \ global marketplace. </p> \n  <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-costs-to-the-uk-of-language-deficiencies-as-a-barrier-to-uk-engagement-in-exporting\"\
            >2014 research by James Foreman-Peck of the University of Cardiff</a>,\
            \ the UK loses an estimated Â£48 billion worth of contracts per year due\
            \ to a lack of language skills in the workforce.</p> \n  <p>By supporting\
            \ our young people to learn two additional languages, we are helping to\
            \ grow our economy.</p> \n  <p>Language learning also improves children's\
            \ communication skills, increases their confidence and encourages a better\
            \ understanding of other countries and cultures.</p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"\
            /publications/scottish-social-attitudes-survey-language-learning-schools/\"\
            >2015 Scottish Social Attitudes Survey (SSA)</a> found that most people\
            \ in Scotland (89%) think that learning a language other than English\
            \ in school from the age of five is important. </p> \n  <h3 id=\"progress-in-implementing-1-2\"\
            >Progress in implementing 1+2</h3> \n  <p>In 2011 we set up the short-life\
            \ Languages Working Group (LWG) to consider how we could improve language\
            \ learning in schools. </p> \n  <p>The LWG published <a href=\"/publications/language-learning-scotland-12-approach/\"\
            >their report, Language Learning in Scotland: a 1+2 approach</a>, in 2012;\

            >The 1+2 language learning policy: Scottish Government response</a>, we\
            \ accepted all of the report's recommendations in full or in part.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>On the LWG's recommendation we set up the <a href=\"https://beta.gov.scot/groups/strategic-implementation-group/\"\
            >Strategic Implementation Group (SIG)</a> in 2013 to oversee delivery\
            \ of the 1+2 policy commitment.</p> \n  <p>In October 2014, the SIG produced\
            \ <a href=\"/publications/the-1-2-language-learning-policy-sig-report/\"\
            >an interim report on the progress with implementation</a>, which also\
            \ set out the priorities for the coming year. </p> \n  <p>We set up a\

            >SIG Engagement Group</a> to take forward some of the actions concerning\

            \ is charged with changing attitudes towards language learning in wider\
            \ society.</p> \n  <p>In June 2016 we commissioned the Association of\
            \ Directors of Education in Scotland (ADES) to produce a <a href=\"/publications/1-2-language-policy-progress-review/\"\
            >review of the progress made so far in implementing 1+2</a>.</p> \n </body>\n\

          <p>We developed much of our current LGBTI policy around the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">Equality Act 2010</a>, which: </p>
          <ul>

          <p>This is largely the result of the introduction of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/5/contents/enacted">Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014</a> and the inclusion of intersex as part of our equality approach.</p>

            \ and social care, housing and sport, justice, education, children and\
            \ families, equality, human rights and third sector. </p> \n  <p>The aim\

            >NHS Scotland Gender Reassignment Protocol (GRP)</a> and sent it to NHS\

            \ is fair, effective, patient-focused and timely. </p> \n  <p>The Scottish\
            \ Transgender Alliance (STA) held focus groups across Scotland to identify\
            \ transgender people's views on NHS gender reassignment services as part\
            \ of the Scottish Government protocol audit. </p> \n  <p>These focus groups\
            \ will inform a report to the Scottish Government on the implementation\
            \ of the protocol and the improvements still needed. </p> \n  <p>The results\
            \ of the STA's Trans Mental Health Study and Scottish Trans Health Conference\

          <p>Local government in Scotland has been made up of 32 local authorities since 1996. You can <a href="http://www.lgbc-scotland.gov.uk/maps/">view local authority boundary maps on the Local Government Boundary Commission website</a>.</p>
          <p>Scotland&#39;s local authorities vary considerably in size and population, but all have responsibility for providing a range of public services to the communities in their area. Read more on our <a href="/publications/local-authorities-factsheet/">local authorities factsheet</a>.</p>
          <p>Each council is made up of councillors who are directly elected by the residents of the area they represent. There are 1,227 elected councillors in Scotland, who are normally elected every four years.</p>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.cosla.gov.uk/">Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA)</a> was formed in 1975 to represent the views of Scotland&#39;s 32 local authorities to central government. It also acts as the employers&#39; association for local authorities. Council officers collaborate with those in other councils through a wide range of professional bodies.

            \ \n  <p>You asked for a list of meetings, the attendance and minutes\

            \ Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance and/or the First Minister of\

            >Response</h2> \n  <p>I enclose the dates and attendance of the meetings\
            \ in the annex to this letter. While our aim is to provide information\
            \ whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not\
            \ have minutes of the meetings. This is because we are not required to\
            \ routinely minute discussion which take place during visits of this nature\
            \ such as goodwill visits, hospitality events, or courtesy conversations.\
            \ As no policy decisions arose in either case it was considered sufficient\
            \ to record within the official diary that the meeting had taken place.\
            \ This is a formal notice under section 17(1) of FOISA that the Scottish\
            \ Government does not have the information you have requested. An exemption\
            \ under section 38(1)(b) of FOISA (personal information) applies to a\
            \ small amount of the information requested because it is personal data,\
            \ i.e. the full name of junior Scottish Government officials, and disclosing\
            \ it would contravene the data protection principles in Schedule 1 to\
            \ the Data Protection Act 1998. If you are unhappy with this response\
            \ to your FOI request, you may ask us to carry out an internal review\
            \ of the response, by writing to Paul Johnston, Director General for Education,\
            \ Communities and Justice at St Andrews House, Edinburgh, EH1 3DG. Your\
            \ review request should explain why you are dissatisfied with this response,\
            \ and should be made within 40 working days from the date when you received\
            \ this letter. We will complete the review and tell you the result, within\
            \ 20 working days from the date when we receive your review request.<br>If\
            \ you are not satisfied with the result of the review, you then have the\
            \ right to appeal to the Scottish Information Commissioner. More detailed\

            \ attend full meetings of the council, and some may have specific roles\

            \ with the residents and interest groups within their ward and dealing\
            \ with issues that they raise. In addition, councillors may attend community\
            \ council meetings and serve on forums through which local issues can\
            \ be discussed between elected members, council officers and the wider\
            \ community</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>From time to time, councillors may also\
            \ be involved in other areas, such as the development of new policies\
            \ for the council.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"other-organisations\">Other organisations</h3>\
            \ \n  <p>Councillors may also sit on the boards of other organisations\

          <p>We are working to improve the experiences and outcomes of all looked after children by: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>commissioning an <a href="https://www.carereview.scot/">independent care review</a> to ensure the care system is meeting the needs of Scotlandâs looked after children and young people</li>

          <p>Our looked after children policy is part of <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/Young-People/gettingitright">Getting It Right For Every Child (GIRFEC)</a> â our national approach to improving outcomes and supporting the wellbeing of children and young people. </p>
          <p>On 15 October 2016 the First Minister announced an independent root and branch review of the care system in Scotland. The <a href="https://www.carereview.scot/">Care Review</a> will be driven and shaped by care experienced young peopleâs voices, stories and experiences. It will look at the underpinning legislation, practices, culture and ethos of the system to drive meaningful, sustainable change for children and young people in Scotland.</p>
          <h3 id="how-a-child-becomes-looked-after">How a child becomes looked after</h3>
          <p>Most looked after children fall into two categories: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Looked after at home â where the child or young person has been through the Children&#39;s Hearings system and is subject to a Supervision Requirement (regular contact with social services) with no condition of residence.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p>or  </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Looked after away from home â where the child or young person has either: <ul>
          <li>been through the Children&#39;s Hearings system and is subject to a Supervision Requirement with a condition of residence </li>
          <li>is subject to an order made or authoritisation or warrant granted by virtue of chapter 2, 3 or 4 of Part 2 of the 1995 Act </li>
          <li>is being provided with accommodation under Section 25 (a voluntary agreement) </li>
          <li>is placed by a local authority which has made a permanence order under section 80 of the Adoption and Children Act 2007 </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>In these cases the child or young person is cared for away from their normal place of residence, by foster or kinship carers, by prospective adopters, or in residential care homes, schools or secure units. </p>
          <h3 id="corporate-parenting">Corporate parenting</h3>
          <p>The Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 defines corporate parenting as &quot;the formal and local partnerships between all services responsible for working together to meet the needs of looked after children, young people and care leavers&quot;. </p>
          <p>The 2014 Act introduced new duties and responsibilities for <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/8/schedule/4/enacted">the 24 Scottish public bodies defined as corporate parents</a>, effective from April 2015. </p>
          <p>A good corporate parent will want the best outcomes for their looked after children, accept responsibility for them, and make their needs a priority. To help public services be good corporate parents we have published:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><a href="/publications/statutory-guidance-part-9-corporate-parenting-children-young-people-scotland/">statutory guidance on corporate parenting</a></li>
          <li><a href="/publications/bairns-guide-community-planning-partnerships-being-good-corporate-parent/">guidance for councils and community planning partnerships on being a good corporate parent</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>We have also commissioned Who Cares? Scotland to provide a programme of training and support for corporate parents, including elected members, local authorities, schools, health boards and other service providers. Find out about this support on the <a href="http://www.corporateparenting.org.uk/">Who Cares? Scotland corporate parenting website</a>, or read more about corporate parenting in general on the <a href="https://www.celcis.org/knowledge-bank/spotlight/corporate-parenting">CELCIS website</a>.</p>

            \ the Permanence and Care Team (PaCT) at the Centre of Excellence for\
            \ Looked After Children (CELCIS). </p> \n  <p>PACE began in 2014 with\
            \ the aim of enabling more looked after children to experience permanence.\
            \ This means providing them with stable, secure and nurturing relationships,\
            \ normally within a family setting, that continue to adulthood. </p> \n\
            \  <p>The programme supports local authorities and their partners - in\
            \ health, Children's Hearings, the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration\
            \ and the courts - to develop projects that will identify delays, blockages\

            \ most to children, and that this is best delivered by removing children\
            \ from long-term supervision, where appropriate, and giving them the legal\
            \ certainty that their relationships are permanent. </p> \n  <p>There\
            \ are a range of different routes to permanence depending on the needs\
            \ and circumstances of the child, and PACE uses an assets-based approach\
            \ to assess the appropriate route for each child. </p> \n  <p>Permanence\
            \ can be achieved through: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>returning or remaining\
            \ at home with or after support, inclusive of settled informal kinship\
            \ care arrangements </li> \n   <li>receiving a permanence order where\
            \ long-term corporate parenting is needed, whether that's through formal\
            \ kinship care, foster care or residential care </li> \n   <li>a relevant\
            \ Section 11 Order, which is intended to be a Kinship Care Order from\
            \ 2015 </li> \n   <li>adoption </li> \n  </ul> \n  <h3 id=\"how-pace-works\"\
            >How PACE works</h3> \n  <p>The PACE programme involves the use of improvement\
            \ methodology and comprises three phases: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>phase\
            \ one: contracting and baseline </li> \n   <li>phase two: diagnosing and\

          <p>Manufacturing is vital to Scotland&#39;s economy, employing more than 180,000 people across the country. The industry accounts for over half of our international exports, and half of our research and development spend.</p>
          <p>We want to improve productivity and increase investment in the manufacturing industry, so that it continues to address regional imbalances, create highly skilled jobs, and grow our economy.</p>
          <p>We launched our Manufacturing Action Plan on 15 February 2016, fulfilling a commitment in the Programme for Government.</p>
          <p>Led by <a href="https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/">Scottish Enterprise</a>, we developed the action plan in partnership with <a href="http://www.hie.co.uk/">Highlands and Islands Enterprise</a>, the <a href="http://www.sfc.ac.uk/">Scottish Funding Council</a>, <a href="https://www.skillsdevelopmentscotland.co.uk/">Skills Development Scotland</a>, and <a href="http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/">Zero Waste Scotland</a>.

            \ Year of Young People.</p> \n  <p>Feedback from stakeholders so far has\
            \ shown that there is a need for an Action Plan which links across multiple\
            \ areas which relate to the lives of children and young people. This should\
            \ be done in a way which puts the child at the centre, takes a developmental\
            \ rather than age based approach and avoids where possible putting children/young\
            \ people and their experiences into boxes. To achieve this we will be\
            \ taking a strong rights based approach which will be threaded throughout\
            \ the plan. Attachment and trauma informed practice will also be featured\
            \ with a strong emphasis on the 'how' of improving health and wellbeing.\
            \ The feedback we have received so far has suggested the following format:</p>\
            \ \n  <h3 id=\"framework\">Framework</h3> \n  <p>A framework which lays\
            \ out the ethos of the Action Plan, shows links with existing policies\
            \ and provides a direction for the Action Plan over the next ten years.\
            \ The Framework will also outline plans for continued engagement and evaluation\
            \ of the Action Plan.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"scotland-s-action-plan\">Scotland's\
            \ Action Plan</h3> \n  <p>An Action Plan which will be owned by relevant\
            \ stakeholders across Scotland. We will be encouraging input to this plan\
            \ at a number of levels and different areas.</p> \n  <p>A website will\
            \ be available shortly which will provide the following:</p> \n  <ul>\
            \ \n   <li>The latest draft of the Framework/Action Plan and details of\
            \ how to comment</li> \n   <li>Previous drafts and notifications of significant\

            \ with clinicians, NHS staff and other stakeholders, and will ensure consistency\
            \ of service across all of Scotland. </p> \n  <h3 id=\"what-s-included\"\
            >What's included</h3> \n  <p>The Pathway mandates 11 home visits for all\
            \ families, three of which include the health visitor doing a formal review\
            \ of the family and child's health. Formal reviews are done when the child\
            \ is: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>aged between 13 and 15 months </li> \n  \
            \ <li>aged between 27 and 30 months </li> \n   <li>about to start school\
            \ </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Home visits cover the antenatal to pre-school\
            \ period and provide an opportunity for health visitors to build relationships\
            \ with children and their parents, in which the health visitor can act\
            \ as a gateway to other services. This early engagement helps prepare\
            \ health visitors to serve as the child's named person until they start\
            \ school.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"increasing-the-workforce\">Increasing the workforce</h3>\
            \ \n  <p>To deliver the universal health visiting service successfully,\
            \ we are working with Health Boards to create 500 additional health visitor\
            \ posts by 2018. </p> \n  <p>We have provided significant funding to expand\
            \ the workforce.</p> \n  <p>According to official statistics published\
            \ 6 June 2017, there are at least an additional 242 health visitors working\
            \ in Scotland since June 2014. Between September 2014 and March 2017,\
            \ 470 students completed their health visitor training. </p> \n  <p>We\
            \ worked out how many more health visitors we would need by using a caseload\
            \ weighting tool developed especially for this purpose. This tool ensured\
            \ consistency in determining health visiting numbers across the country,\
            \ and also allowed for local variation influenced by particular circumstances.\

            \ works</h3> \n  <p>Negative experiences and poor parenting during pregnancy\
            \ and early childhood can damage a child's brain development, behaviour,\
            \ learning, and long-term health. </p> \n  <p>The FNP aims to prevent\
            \ such damage by having a specially trained nurse visit the homes of first-time\
            \ teenage mothers from early pregnancy (before 28 weeks) until their child\
            \ is two years old. </p> \n  <p>During these visits, the nurse builds\
            \ a relationship with the mother and uses materials and activities designed\
            \ to change health behaviour, tackle emotional problems, improve care-giving,\
            \ and increase economic self-sufficiency. </p> \n  <p>Midwives continue\
            \ to deliver maternity care during the antenatal period. Once the child\
            \ is born, the family nurse continues to visit the family until either\
            \ the child reaches age two, or the family leaves the programme, at which\
            \ point they become supported by the local <a href=\"universal-health-visiting-service\"\
            >health visiting service</a>. </p> \n  <p>The family nurse also takes\
            \ on the named person role, as agreed by their organisation. </p> \n \
            \ <p>The FNP's three main aims are to improve: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>pregnancy\
            \ and birth outcomes </li> \n   <li>child health and development </li>\
            \ \n   <li>parents' economic self-sufficiency </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The\
            \ methods used are based on theories of human ecology, self-efficacy and\
            \ attachment, with a focus on building a strong relationship between the\
            \ family nurse and the client. </p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/kX2R8lEOBZc\"\

            \ where it is known as the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP). Over 35 years\
            \ of research, the programme has been shown to produce many benefits including:\
            \ </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>improved early language development and academic\
            \ achievement </li> \n   <li>improvements in antenatal health </li> \n\
            \   <li>reductions in children's injuries, neglect and abuse </li> \n\
            \   <li>improved parenting practices and behaviour </li> \n   <li>fewer\
            \ subsequent pregnancies and greater intervals between births </li> \n\
            \   <li>increased maternal employment and reduced welfare use </li> \n\
            \   <li>increased involvement from fathers </li> \n   <li>reduced arrests\
            \ and criminal behaviour for both children and mothers </li> \n  </ul>\
            \ \n  <p>An international review by The Lancet in 2008 named the NFP/FNP\
            \ as one of only two programmes shown to prevent child maltreatment. <a\
            \ href=\"http://bit.ly/2wfVDtg\">Read the review: Interventions to prevent\
            \ child maltreatment and associated impairment</a>.</p> \n  <p>Since 2010,\
            \ more than 1,500 families have graduated from the FNP programme in Scotland\
            \ with almost 2,600 families receiving the programme at any one time.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>Every year we publish national statistics on key process\
            \ and outcome measures associated with the programme, in line with the\

            \ <a href=\"/publications/more-homes-scotland/\">More Homes Scotland</a>\
            \ approach and linked to the delivery of 50,000 affordable homes by 2021,\
            \ the Scottish Government launched a five-year Housing Infrastructure\
            \ Fund (HIF) in February 2016. The fund operates nationally and will be\
            \ managed and administered by us.</p> \n  <p>HIF will support the delivery\
            \ of housing through financial assistance. While all types and tenures\
            \ of housing are <a href=\"/publications/housing-infrastructure-fund-eligibility-criteria/\"\
            >eligible for HIF support</a>, priority will be given to those projects\
            \ delivering affordable and private rented housing within the five-year\
            \ period ending 31 March 2021.</p> \n  <p>The fund comprises two main\
            \ elements:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>infrastructure loans available to non-public\
            \ sector organisations</li> \n   <li>infrastructure grant available to\
            \ local authorities and Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) to support\
            \ affordable housing delivery</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Local authorities\
            \ are invited, as part of the development of their Strategic Housing Investment\
            \ Plans (SHIPs), to identify key strategic priority sites for housing\
            \ that could, with the fund's support, be unlocked to bring forward completed\
            \ housing by 31 March 2021. Such projects should be included in the next\
            \ SHIP submissions due on 29 October 2017.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"principles-applying-to-hif-projects\"\
            >Principles applying to HIF projects</h3> \n  <p>HIF helps key strategic\
            \ housing projects which have been blocked or unable to proceed due to\
            \ the extent and costs/financing of infrastructure works involved.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>The policy objective of HIF is to enable the delivery of new\
            \ additional housing, primarily affordable housing, to support the 50,000\
            \ target. Priority will therefore be given to sites that will deliver\
            \ completed affordable housing by 31 March 2021 to contribute to the 50,000\
            \ target.</p> \n  <p>Housing Infrastructure Grant will be available to\
            \ local authorities and RSLs for the delivery of affordable housing sites\
            \ where the scale and nature of infrastructure costs would prevent it\
            \ from being supported through the <a href=\"affordable-housing-supply\"\
            >Affordable Housing Supply Programme (AHSP)</a>.</p> \n  <p>Although HIF\
            \ is available as grant or loan we would expect that only one of these\
            \ elements would be accessed in mixed ownership/tenure sites. In most\
            \ cases the decision on whether grant or loan is most appropriate will\
            \ be led by the organisation which is project managing the overall development.</p>\
            \ \n  <h3 id=\"eligible-works\">Eligible Works</h3> \n  <h4 id=\"hif-grant-projects\"\
            >HIF Grant Projects</h4> \n  <p>Funding should only be directed to infrastructure\
            \ works which are either outwith the curtilage of the affordable housing\
            \ site or projects which are of scale and will open up larger sites for\
            \ housing development. For clarity, works which are solely contained within\
            \ the curtilage of an affordable housing site will not be eligible for\
            \ HIF as these should be managed within the flexibilities of the AHSP\
            \ process.</p> \n  <h4 id=\"hif-loan-projects\">HIF loan projects</h4>\
            \ \n  <p>Eligible works include physical infrastructure generally required\
            \ to start a project, such as roads, sewers, sustainable urban drainage\
            \ system (SUDS) ponds, decontamination, flood remediation and demolition\
            \ work.</p> \n  <p>Where <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/8/section/75\"\
            >section 75 (s75) obligation</a> requires it, certain off-site infrastructure\
            \ may also be eligible.</p> \n  <h4 id=\"non-hif-eligible-works\">Non-HIF\
            \ eligible works</h4> \n  <p>The following works are not eligible for\
            \ HIF:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>the provision of some forms of community\
            \ infrastructure required as a consequence of new housing development,\
            \ for example, s75 contributions for schools</li> \n   <li>developer contributions\
            \ towards affordable housing provision required through s75 or affordable\
            \ housing policies </li> \n   <li>replacing other public sector contributions\
            \ (for example, Scottish Water or Transport Scotland) for major infrastructure\
            \ which these bodies should be directly funding</li> \n   <li>works or\
            \ other items which local authorities or RSLs would normally fund from\
            \ their own resources including, for example, general land acquisitions\
            \ or acquisitions of property and land made under compulsory purchase\
            \ orders (CPOs)</li> \n   <li>major roadworks such as upgrading or realignment\
            \ of trunk roads which will not directly support housing delivery within\
            \ the five-year period</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The above list is not exhaustive.</p>\

            \ twelve bonds with total investments of Â£70m providing development finance\
            \ for 935 affordable homes and generating over Â£17m in additional grant\

            \ of MMR through the mainstream grant-funded <a href=\"affordable-housing-supply\"\

            \ private rented sector identified the need for a focus on bringing Scotland's\
            \ empty homes back into use, particularly, but not exclusively, to house\
            \ homeless or low-income households. Long-term empty properties are a\
            \ wasted resource at a time when Scotland needs more homes, and can be\
            \ a blight on communities. Our focus is on bringing as many empty homes\
            \ back into use as possible.</p> \n  <p>The latest figures, for September\
            \ 2016, show that there were 35,727 properties that had been empty for\
            \ more than six months, a reduction on the previous year. Of these, just\
            \ under over half (20,784 or 58%) had been empty for over 12 months.</p>\
            \ \n  <h3 id=\"empty-homes-partnership\">Empty Homes Partnership</h3>\
            \ \n  <p>Since 2010, we have funded a partnership with Shelter Scotland\
            \ to help councils work with owners of empty homes. The partnership has\
            \ brought more than 1,700 homes back into use so far.</p> \n  <p>More\

            \ problematic empty homes. Currently, more than half of Scotland's councils\

            \ wellbeing. Since beginning at St Ninians Primary, Stirling, in 2012,\
            \ The Daily Mile has grown exponentially, with over 3,000 participating\
            \ schools, and over half a million children taking part daily.</p> \n\

          <p>The main pieces of legislation which the planning system operates under are: </p>
          <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/8/contents">Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997</a> </li>
          <li><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2006/17/contents">Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006</a> </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="secondary-legislation">Secondary legislation</h3>
          <p>Since the 2006 Act, various pieces of secondary legislation have been brought in to implement the provisions within the act. These regulations are supported by <a href="/publications/planning-circulars-index/">Circulars</a> which provide an explanation of the relevant regulations. Circulars are available on the relevant pages in this section and on the <a href="/policies/planning-architecture/planning-guidance/">producing planning guidance</a> page.</p>

            \ the planning system's contribution to inclusive growth and empowering\
            \ communities. The Bill sets out our proposed high level changes to the\

            \ new provisions will work in practice will be contained within secondary\
            \ legislation and guidance. Following Parliamentary scrutiny of the Bill\
            \ we will commence work on developing the required secondary legislation\
            \ through a longer term, collaborative programme of work. The Bill and\
            \ Accompanying Documents are available on the Scottish Parliament's <a\

            \ \n  <p>In September 2015 an independent panel was appointed by Scottish\

            \ for reform over six main themes. </p> \n  <p>In July 2016, Ministers\
            \ issued <a href=\"/publications/planning-review-sg-response/\">their\
            \ response</a> to the panel's report which stated that they agreed in\
            \ principle with many of the recommendations.</p> \n  <p>In January 2017\
            \ we published a consultation on the future of planning in Scotland which\
            \ ran until April 2017. The consultation paper, <a href=\"/publications/places-people-planning-consultation-future-scottish-planning-system/\"\
            >Places, people and planning</a>, set out 20 proposals for change to strengthen\
            \ the planning system and support sustainable economic growth across the\
            \ country. The proposals build on the <a href=\"/publications/empowering-planning-to-deliver-great-places/\"\
            >recommendations of the independent review</a>. An <a href=\"/publications/planning-review-analysis-of-consultation-responses-june-2017/\"\
            >independent analysis of the consultation responses</a> was published\
            \ in June 2017.</p> \n  <p>We published <a href=\"https://consult.scotland.gov.uk/planning-architecture/places-people-and-planning-position-statement/\"\
            >Places, People and Planning position statement</a> in June 2017 which\
            \ set out our future priorities for the planning system in Scotland, taking\
            \ account of responses to the consultation. This statement was accompanied\
            \ by a <a href=\"https://consult.scotland.gov.uk/planning-architecture/places-people-and-planning-position-statement/\"\
            >Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) Environmental Report</a>. An <a\

            >independent analysis of the consultation responses</a> was published\
            \ in October 2017.</p> \n  <p>The Position Statement proposed both legislative\
            \ and non-legislative changes. Changes to primary legislation are being\
            \ taken forward through the Planning Bill. Further changes will be made\
            \ through secondary legislation following the Bill. Non-legislative improvements\
            \ such as new policy, guidance, better co-ordination and support for performance\
            \ improvements will continue alongside the legislative programme. This\
            \ wide <a href=\"/publications/planning-review-independent-panel-recommendations-actions-taken/\"\
            >range of actions</a> broadly reflects the recommendations of the independent\
            \ review.</p> \n  <p>The Bill is central to our package of measures intended\
            \ to strengthen the planning system's contribution to inclusive growth\
            \ and empowering communities. The Bill sets out our high level changes\
            \ to the overall framework under which planning operates with the detail\
            \ of how the new provisions will work in practice contained within secondary\
            \ legislation and guidance. Following parliamentary scrutiny of the Bill\
            \ we will commence work on developing the required secondary legislation\
            \ through a longer term, collaborative programme of work.</p> \n  <h3\

            \  </ul> \n  <p>In the case of delegated decisions the appeal would be\

            \ delegated to a reporter from the Planning and Environmental Appeals\
            \ Division who will make a decision on their behalf. Appeals for Listed\

            \ \n  <h3 id=\"compulsory-purchase-orders\">Compulsory Purchase Orders</h3>\
            \ \n  <p>A Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) can allow councils and other\
            \ organisations to purchase property without the owner's permission, if\
            \ there is a strong enough case for this in the public interest. </p>\
            \ \n  <p>For example, a CPO can be used to enable:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>road\
            \ construction, alteration or improvement projects </li> \n   <li>restoration\

            \ \n   <li>town centre regeneration </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>CPOs promoted\
            \ by public bodies and infrastructure providers must be confirmed by Scottish\
            \ Ministers. If someone objects to a CPO then the case is referred to\
            \ DPEA for a report to be prepared to inform Scottish Ministers' decision.\
            \ Ministers will consider the report and any remaining objections, and\
            \ weigh up the proposed public benefit of the project underpinning the\
            \ CPO against the interests of the people affected.</p> \n  <p>Ministers\
            \ may choose to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>confirm a CPO</li> \n   <li>confirm\
            \ a CPO with modifications </li> \n   <li>not confirm the CPO</li> \n\
            \  </ul> \n  <p>There is also <a href=\"/publications/compulsory-purchase-orders-introduction/\"\

            >case studies</a>.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"article-4-directions\">Article 4 Directions</h3>\
            \ \n  <p>An Article 4 Direction is made by a local planning authority.\
            \ It is a statement made under the Town and Country Planning Act which\
            \ restricts permitted development rights. These directions must usually\
            \ be approved/confirmed by Scottish Ministers before coming into effect.\
            \ Local residents and others likely to be affected by any proposed Direction\
            \ will normally be consulted by the planning authority. </p> \n  <p>Within\
            \ conservation areas planning permission will usually be required for\
            \ specific types of development which would otherwise be permitted. For\
            \ example: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>the replacement of doors and windows</li>\
            \ \n   <li>the erection of gates, fences, garages, sheds, porches or storage\
            \ tanks </li> \n   <li>the installation of satellite antennae</li> \n\

            >Stopping Up Orders</h3> \n  <p>If there is a need to divert or 'stop\
            \ up' a road, footpath or bridleway permanently to enable a development\
            \ to be carried out, a 'Stopping Up Order' may be required. Stopping Up\
            \ Orders are usually enforced by councils and should only be submitted\

            \ to three parts: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p>a Strategic Development Plan\
            \ (SDP) is required for the four largest city regions â Aberdeen, Dundee,\
            \ Edinburgh and Glasgow. These deal with region-wide issues that cross\
            \ boundaries of council areas, for example the scale of housing and the\
            \ transport and water and connections needed. SDPs must be submitted to\
            \ Scottish Ministers within four years of approval of the existing plan.\
            \ </p> </li> \n   <li><p>a Local Development Plan (LDP) is required for\
            \ each council area across Scotland. It allocates sites, either for new\
            \ development, such as housing, or sites to be protected. It also includes\
            \ policies that guide decisions on all planning applications. LDPs must\
            \ be adopted within five years of the previous plan. LDPs in SDP areas\
            \ should be adopted within two years of the approval of the SDP. </p>\
            \ </li> \n   <li><p>Supplementary Guidance can be part of the Development\
            \ Plan when it has met legal requirements, including carrying out a public\
            \ consultation. It can provide further information or detail on the polices\
            \ or proposals that are in the development plan.</p> </li> \n  </ul> \n\
            \  <h2 id=\"scottish-government-involvement-in-development-plans\">Scottish\
            \ Government involvement in development plans</h2> \n  <p>Our <a href=\"\
            /publications/change-involvement-development-plan-preparation/\">Development\
            \ Plan Service Standard</a> sets out how the Planning and Architecture\
            \ Division will support planning authorities in preparing development\
            \ plans. When the Service Standard was published in August 2016 <a href=\"\
            /publications/change-involvement-development-plan-preparation/\">a letter\
            \ was sent to all Heads of Planning across Scotland</a> and development\
            \ plan teams. This was accompanied by <a href=\"/publications/change-involvement-development-plan-preparation/\"\
            >a development plan preparation guide for authorities</a> on the matters\
            \ regularly raised by us.</p> \n  <h2 id=\"development-plan-schemes\"\
            >Development plan schemes</h2> \n  <p>Every year all planning authorities\
            \ in Scotland produce a development plan scheme. This scheme sets out\
            \ the programme for preparing and reviewing their development plans. These\
            \ can be found on planning authorities' websites. </p> \n  <h3 id=\"public-engagement-in-development-plans\"\
            >Public engagement in development plans</h3> \n  <p>We encourage public\
            \ engagement in the planning process. More information is available on\
            \ the <a href=\"community-planning-process\">community involvement</a>\
            \ page.</p> \n  <p>Planning authorities are required by law to provide\
            \ opportunities for people to get involved in development plans, and are\
            \ expected to go beyond the statutory minimum set out in <a href=\"/publications/planning-series-circular-6-2013-development-planning/\"\
            >Circular 6/2013</a>. </p> \n  <p>Development Plan Schemes must include\
            \ a Participation Statement. This Statement should say how, and with whom,\
            \ consultation on the plan will take place. It should also say how they\
            \ intend to involve the public and stakeholders in the preparation of\
            \ the plan. </p> \n  <p>The time around the publication of the Main Issues\
            \ Report, the planning consultation document, provides the main opportunity\
            \ for early engagement to inform the plan content. The Proposed Plan â\
            \ the settled view of the Council after taking account of the views made\
            \ so far â is then consulted on. Planning authorities must include a Report\
            \ of Conformity with their Participation Statement with their Participation\
            \ Statement when submitting their plan to Scottish Ministers. This should\
            \ show how they have carried out their planned community engagement.</p>\
            \ \n  <h3 id=\"examination-of-development-plans\">Examination of development\
            \ plans</h3> \n  <p>If there are still unresolved issues after consultation\
            \ on Proposed Plans then the planning authority must <a href=\"https://beta.gov.scot/publications/development-plan-examinations/\"\
            >submit the plan to Scottish Ministers for examination</a>. We will appoint\
            \ a reporter to carry out the examination and they may make requests for\
            \ further information, or they may decide to hold a hearing to explore\
            \ issues further. </p> \n  <p>The reporter will submit a report of the\
            \ examination containing conclusions and recommendations to the planning\
            \ authority. Any recommended modifications must be carried out by the\
            \ planning authority (with limited exceptions). </p> \n  <h3 id=\"development-plan-correspondence\"\
            >Development plan correspondence</h3> \n  <p>We have compiled <a href=\"\
            /publications/local-development-plan-correspondence-list/\">a list of\
            \ all the local development plans</a> for which documentation and correspondence\
            \ is available. </p> \n  <h3 id=\"development-planning-forum\">Development\
            \ Planning Forum</h3> \n  <p>We hold a regular Development Planning Forum\
            \ which brings together planning authorities and agencies to discuss and\
            \ share ideas on best practice. The <a href=\"http://blogs.scotland.gov.uk/planningarchitecture/\"\
            >Planning and Architecture blog</a> provides more information on this\
            \ event. </p> \n  <h3 id=\"gateway-review\">Gateway review</h3> \n  <p>It's\
            \ important that the development plan process is managed well. We published\
            \ <a href=\"/publications/development-plan-project-management-review/\"\
            >development plan project management guidance</a> to encourage planning\
            \ authorities to carry out gateway reviews of their development plan preparation\
            \ process. An independent review team should advise on project progress\
            \ as part of the process. We piloted this process with with Orkney Islands\
            \ Council and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority, and\
            \ published the results in a <a href=\"/publications/development-plan-project-management-review/\"\
            >development plan project management review</a>.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"environmental-assessments\"\
            >Environmental assessments</h3> \n  <p>Scottish plans, programmes and\
            \ projects need to be assessed for the potential effects on our environment.\
            \ Development plans are therefore normally subject to a Strategic Environmental\
            \ Assessment (SEA) and potentially a Habits Regulation Assessment (HRA).\
            \ </p> \n  <h4 id=\"strategic-environmental-assessment\">Strategic Environmental\
            \ Assessment</h4> \n  <p>Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) helps\
            \ to identify and define impacts on the environment of development plans.\
            \ During the early preparation stage SEA also considers potential methods\
            \ for protecting the environment where possible. SEA also provides an\
            \ early opportunity for the public to get involved in decision making\
            \ by providing a better understanding of the likely environmental effects.\
            \ SEA can do this by: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p>ensuring expert views\
            \ and opinions are sought from Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), Scottish\
            \ Environmental Protection Aganecy (SEPA), Historic Scotland and the public\
            \ at various points in the process </p> </li> \n   <li><p>considering\
            \ reasonable alternatives within the Development Plan</p> </li> \n   <li><p>considering\
            \ methods to avoid, limit and/or reduce adverse environmental effects\
            \ </p> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <h4 id=\"habitats-regulations-appraisal\">Habitats\
            \ Regulations Appraisal</h4> \n  <p>The Conservation (Natural Habitats,\
            \ &amp; c.) Regulations 1994 require those Development Plans that potentially\
            \ could have an effect on a European-designated site e.g. Special Protection\
            \ Area (SPA) must be subject to an 'Appropriate Assessment' by the plan-making\
            \ authority. The assessment process and the assessment itself is known\
            \ as 'Habitats Regulations Appraisal'(HRA). </p> \n  <p>We have produced\
            \ some <a href=\"/publications/habitats-regulations-appraisal-development-plans-advice-sheets/\"\

            \ planning authorities</h3> \n  <p>Planning authorities will usually determine\
            \ applications for planning permission and must also produce development\
            \ plans. They must also ensure development is carried out correctly and\
            \ take action when it is not. Enforcement action procedures are set out\
            \ in <a href=\"/publications/planning-circular-10-2009-planning-enforcement/\"\
            >Circular 10/2009</a>. </p> \n  <p>Authorities also have to produce an\
            \ enforcement charter at least every two years, which sets out when and\
            \ how enforcement action will be taken. We have published an <a href=\"\

            \ groups together certain similar types of uses of land or buildings into\
            \ classes. Where a building or land is used for a purpose in a particular\
            \ class, using it for any other purpose in the same class does not involve\
            \ development and would therefore not need planning permission (depending\
            \ on the specific conditions and circumstances).</p> \n  <p>If a change\
            \ in the use of a building or land means that it falls within another\
            \ class of use then planning permission may be required. This could be\
            \ because of the impact on local amenity, for example traffic generation,\
            \ noise and visual appearance. </p> \n  <h3 id=\"permitted-development-rights\"\

            \ \n  <p>Users answer 14 questions and the answers are plotted in a simple\
            \ diagram which represents a qualitative evaluation of a place. The results\

            \ \n  <p>These events enable the community, industry and public bodies\
            \ to work directly with professional designers and experts to generate\
            \ a specific vision, masterplan and action plan. The collaborative nature\
            \ of charrettes allows the wider social and economic issues of the community\
            \ to be considered alongside physical design issues. </p> \n  <p>Forty-eight\
            \ charrettes have been funded since 2011. Of the 17 charrettes funded\
            \ during 2015 and 2016, eight were commissioned directly by communities.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>A new round of funding for the period 2016 to 2017 was made available\
            \ to help community groups, local authorities and third sector organisations\

            \ income families are not seeing their living standards improving over\
            \ time) </li> \n   <li>less than 5% should be living with combined low\

          <p>Asylum is a matter reserved to the UK Government and handled by the Home Office. We are responsible for devolved matters, including access to essential services like healthcare and education, that enable the integration of refugees and asylum seekers in Scottish communities. </p>
          <p>Scotlandâs New Scots approach is to support refugees and asylum seekers to integrate into our communities from day one of arrival.  </p>
          <p>A refugee is a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war, violence or persecution. They have had their status as a refugee recognised under the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.</p>
          <p>A refugee is entitled to the same social and economic rights as any UK citizen. Refugees have full access to medical treatment, education, benefits, housing and employment. </p>
          <p>An asylum seeker is a person who has asked a government to recognise their refugee status and is waiting to hear the outcome of their application. </p>
          <p>Some people seeking asylum are moved to Scotland as part of the UK Governmentâs dispersal policy within the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/33/contents">Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</a>.</p>

            \ \n  <p>We agreed the Town Centre First Principle with COSLA leaders\
            \ in July 2014, marking a significant shift in public policy towards town\
            \ centres. It asks that government, local authorities, the wider public\
            \ sector, businesses and communities put the health of town centres at\
            \ the heart of proportionate and best-value decision making, seeking to\
            \ deliver the best local outcomes regarding investment and de-investment\
            \ decisions, alignment of policies, targeting of available resources to\
            \ priority town centre sites, and encouraging vibrancy, equality and diversity.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>In making the agreement, we committed to a collaborative\
            \ approach which understands and underpins the long-term plan for each\
            \ town centre.</p> \n  <p>The Principle is not a duty and it is not prescriptive.\
            \ Taking local needs and circumstances into account, it is about:</p>\
            \ \n  <ul> \n   <li>adopting an approach to decisions that considers the\
            \ vibrancy of town centres as a starting point</li> \n   <li>ensuring\
            \ that the health of town centres features in decision-making processes</li>\
            \ \n   <li>open, measured and transparent decision making that takes account\
            \ of medium to longer-term impacts on town centres</li> \n   <li>recognising\
            \ that town centre locations are not always suitable and making sure that\
            \ the reasons for locating elsewhere are transparent and backed by evidence</li>\
            \ \n  </ul> \n  <p>Local authorities and wider public bodies have embraced\
            \ the principle since its inception and are driving positive change by\
            \ prioritising town centres in public investment decisions.</p> \n  <h3\

            >Scottish Attainment Challenge</h3> \n  <p>The Scottish Attainment Challenge\
            \ is about achieving equity in education. This can be achieved by ensuring\
            \ every child has the same opportunity to succeed, with a particular focus\
            \ on closing the poverty-related attainment gap. </p> \n  <p>The Scottish\
            \ Attainment Challenge was launched by the First Minister in February\
            \ 2015. It is underpinned by The National Improvement Framework, Curriculum\
            \ for Excellence and Getting it Right for Every Child.</p> \n  <p>It focuses\
            \ on improvement activity in literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing\
            \ in specific areas of Scotland. It will also support and complement the\
            \ broader range of initiatives and programmes to ensure that all of Scotland's\
            \ children and young people reach their full potential.</p> \n  <p>The\
            \ Â£750 million Attainment Scotland Fund is a targeted initiative focused\
            \ on supporting pupils in the local authorities of Scotland with the highest\
            \ concentrations of deprivation.</p> \n  <p>The nine 'Challenge Authorities'\
            \ are Glasgow, Dundee, Inverclyde, West Dunbartonshire, North Ayrshire,\
            \ Clackmannanshire, North Lanarkshire, East Ayrshire and Renfrewshire.\
            \ It initially focused on primary schools.</p> \n  <p>A number of primary\
            \ schools outwith the Challenge Authorities, with significant proportions\
            \ of their pupils living in deprived areas are also benefiting. These\
            \ schools have been identified on the basis of supporting a significant\
            \ proportion of pupils and families from communities which are facing\
            \ some of the greatest challenges. Many of these schools are already doing\
            \ well for all of their pupils and we want to learn from and spread this\
            \ practice. </p> \n  <p>The scope of the attainment challenge is being\
            \ extended to support up to 133 secondary schools.</p> \n  <h4 id=\"pupil-equity-fund-pef-\"\
            >Pupil Equity Fund (PEF)</h4> \n  <p>The Pupil Equity Fund is being provided\
            \ as part of the Â£750 million Attainment Scotland Fund which will be invested\
            \ over the current parliamentary term (2016 to 2021). </p> \n  <p>The\
            \ Pupil Equity Fund is allocated directly to schools and targeted at closing\
            \ the poverty related attainment gap. In 2017 to 2018, Â£120 million will\
            \ be distributed. </p> \n  <p>Every council area is benefitting from Pupil\
            \ Equity Funding and 95% of schools in Scotland have been allocated funding\
            \ for pupils in P1-S3 known to be eligible for free school meals. </p>\
            \ \n  <p>This funding is to be spent at the discretion of the head-teacher\
            \ working in partnership with each other and their local authority. Schools\
            \ will now have their plans in place for using their funding and will\
            \ be implementing those plans. </p> \n  <p>Related information</p> \n\

          <p>Scotland&#39;s reputation for excellent science and research is underpinned by the work that goes on at its universities. </p>
          <p>Five of Scotland&#39;s universities are in the Top 200 of the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2016 to 2017, making Scotland second in the world for the number of world-class universities per head of population. </p>
          <p>Researchers in Scotland&#39;s universities are responsible for many major discoveries and innovations, including the MRI scanner, the development of keyhole surgery, and the theory that first posited the existence of the Higgs-Boson particle.</p>
          <p>Our long-term commitment to supporting the higher education sector has contributed to Scotland&#39;s universities achieving excellent results in the recent Research Excellence Framework (REF2014). </p>
          <p>The REF is conducted jointly by the: </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) </li>
          <li>Scottish Funding Council (SFC) </li>
          <li>Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) </li>
          <li>Department of Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland (DELNI) </li>
          </ul>
          <p>In REF2014, 77% of Scotland&#39;s university research was deemed &#39;world-leading&#39; or &#39;internationally excellent&#39;. This is a greater percentage than for the UK as a whole. </p>
          <p>In addition, 85.9% of Scottish research is judged to have an &#39;outstanding&#39; or &#39;very considerable&#39; impact on the economy, society and culture beyond academia, compared with 83.9% for the UK.</p>

            >Public funding</h3> \n  <p>Public funding for university research in\
            \ Scotland is delivered by a dual support system comprising: </p> \n \
            \ <ul> \n   <li>a block grant given by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC)\
            \ </li> \n   <li>competitively awarded grants from the UK-wide Research\
            \ Councils </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The Scottish Government is the largest\
            \ single source of university research funding in Scotland, with funding\
            \ allocated through the SFC. The SFC supports the competitiveness of Scotland's\
            \ research base through a range of investments, as well as the training\
            \ and development of postgraduate teaching and research students. </p>\
            \ \n  <p>As part of our overall funding for higher education, we are investing\
            \ Â£279 million in core research and knowledge exchange and innovation\
            \ in our universities from 2017 to 2018. </p> \n  <h4 id=\"eu-funding\"\
            >EU funding</h4> \n  <p>Scotland is also an active and valued partner\
            \ in a large number of EU research collaborations and has secured significant\
            \ funding from EU research programmes as a result. </p> \n  <p>From 2015\
            \ to 2016 our universities secured Â£97 million from various EU sources\
            \ (including EU government, charities, business and other sources) representing\
            \ 10.1% of their total research income. </p> \n  <p>One prominent source\
            \ of EU funding is the <a href=\"/publications/horizon-2020/\">Horizon\
            \ 2020</a> programme for research and innovation. Between 2014 and 2020,\
            \ Horizon 2020 is making more than â¬76 billion of funding available for\
            \ cutting-edge projects. The aim is to ensure that the best ideas and\
            \ discoveries are brought to the market faster, so that their results\
            \ may help drive social and economic growth in Europe. Scottish Higher\
            \ Education Institutions have secured a total of â¬289 million and almost\
            \ â¬24 million to research institutes under Horizon 2020 (up to May 2017)\
            \ based on our world-class research.</p> \n  <p>Advice and information\

            >International collaboration</h3> \n  <p>Our excellence in research is\
            \ underpinned by extensive collaborations worldwide. </p> \n  <p>Scotland\
            \ can point to significant successes in working across European boundaries\
            \ with international research centres that are increasingly attracted\
            \ to Scotland by the quality of our research base. These include: </p>\
            \ \n  <ul> \n   <li>the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Photonics â the\
            \ first Fraunhofer Institute to be located in the UK, located at Technology\
            \ and Innovation Centre, University of Strathclyde </li> \n   <li>the\
            \ Â£100 million Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) European Lead Factory\
            \ Programme, which will speed up the development of new drugs â won by\
            \ BioCity Scotland, the University of Dundee and the Scottish Universities\
            \ Life Science Alliance (SULSA) with the support of Dutch and English\
            \ partners </li> \n   <li>the world's first international Max-Planck Partnership\
            \ â a multi-million-pound partnership with five prestigious Max-Planck\
            \ Institutes (MPI) in Germany and leading physics research groups from\
            \ the Universities of Glasgow, Strathclyde, St Andrews, Heriot-Watt and\
            \ Edinburgh </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Our university research also works\
            \ across international boundaries. One example is the Gravitational Waves\
            \ collaboration, where scientists from 17 countries â including researchers\
            \ at the Universities of Glasgow, Strathclyde, West of Scotland and Edinburgh\
            \ â were involved in the research and discovery of gravitational waves.\
            \ Glasgow is the UK's leading university for gravitational research. </p>\

          <p>To make sure that the sea fishing industry is sustainable, well-managed and profitable we are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>managing fish stocks to protect stock reproduction, share fishing opportunities fairly and preserve marine resources</li>
          <li>supporting and regulating inshore fisheries</li>
          <li>making sure that the landing obligation (the &#39;discard ban&#39; which means that catches of quota fish can no longer be returned to the sea) is enforced in a proportionate and manageable way</li>
          <li>using licensing and compliance to protect Scotland&#39;s marine areas and fisheries</li>
          <li>administering grants (link to mygov)</li>
          <li>carrying out research into fish capture methods and collecting information on fish stocks, in order to make the most of them and minimise waste</li>
          <li>supporting work to certify fisheries as sustainable so people can make informed choices about the fish they buy</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Within the EU, Scotland&#39;s seas are the fourth largest of core European waters, and make up over 60 per cent of the UK&#39;s total European waters.</p>
          <p>Many of the fisheries that are important to Scotland are managed in a joint international context, mostly through the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/index_en.htm">EU&#39;s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)</a>. Because of Scotland&#39;s prominent role in fishing, we play a major part in developing Europe&#39;s fisheries management policies. And we implement them in the waters around Scotland, and on Scotland&#39;s fleet wherever it fishes.</p>
          <p>We also participate in the North Sea and the North West Waters regional groups which cover the waters around Scotland.</p>
          <p>At a UK level we work with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs">Department for Environment Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra)</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/marine-management-organisation">Marine Management Organisation (MMO)</a> and <a href="http://www.seafish.org/">Seafish</a>.</p>
          <p>In May 2012, the UK Fisheries Administrations agreed a new <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Topics/marine/Sea-Fisheries/context/Concordat/concordatdoc">Concordat on Fisheries Management in the UK</a>. This agreement between the Administrations in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland provides clearer definitions of the fisheries management responsibilities for each country. It gives them more flexibility to develop fishing policies that suit them best.</p>

          <p>The Right to Buy was abolished for all social housing tenants in Scotland by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2014/14/contents/enacted">Housing (Scotland) Act 2014</a>. This will preserve housing stock for the future and means that social landlords will receive a steady rental income. </p>
          <p>The Act changed allocation rules for social landlords to increase flexibility and allow them to make the best use of social housing. It also allows landlords to issue Short Scottish Secure Tenancies (Short SSTs) to address antisocial behaviour, and help homeowners in genunine housing need.</p>

          <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2014 changes some aspects of the law on social housing allocations and management. The Scottish Government has developed guidance which will be formally published in 2018 after the Commencement Order for the provisions has been passed by the Scottish Parliament. We expect to lay the SSIs required for this in spring 2018.</p>

          <p>In addition, to help landlords undertake training on the changes being introduced by the 2014 Act, we have made <a href="/publications/housing-scotland-act-2014-training-pack/">PowerPoint presentations with speakers&#39; notes</a> available. These are flexible resources which landlords can adapt to reflect their own allocations and housing management policies. They do not constitute legal advice and users of the material should bear in mind the disclaimer at the start of the presentations.

            \ \n  <p>A majority of owners in a tenement can make a binding decision\
            \ to carry out maintenance and repairs. Local authorities can pay a 'missing\
            \ share' on behalf of owners who are unable or unwilling to comply with\
            \ the majority decision. The local authority can recover its costs and\
            \ use a repayment charge, a kind of security against the property.</p>\
            \ \n  <p>Scottish Ministers can also regulate to allow registered social\
            \ landlords a similar discretionary power to pay and recover 'missing\
            \ shares'. Before Ministers can make regulations, they must consult bodies\
            \ representing location authorities and registered social landlords, among\
            \ others.</p> \n  <p>The Scottish Government has <a href=\"/publications/registered-social-landlord-missing-share-consultation/\"\
            >published the results of a such a consultation</a>. Having considered\
            \ responses to it, the Scottish Government intends to bring forward regulations\

            \ is a payment reserved to the UK Government that combines six in- and\
            \ out-of-work benefits into a single monthly payment. It replaces:</p>\
            \ \n  <ul> \n   <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</li>\
            \ \n   <li>income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA)</li> \n   <li>Housing\

            \ \n   <li>Income Support</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The UK Government will\
            \ continue to roll out Universal Credit for new claims until September\
            \ 2018. Following that people in receipt of the legacy benefits above,\
            \ eg JSA, will be transferred over to Universal Credit over a period of\
            \ time. The roll out will not be finished until 2022.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"\

            \ Scotland Act 2016 allows the Scottish Government to provide choices\
            \ to people when claiming.</p> \n  <p>On 29 June 2017, regulations were\
            \ laid in the Scottish Parliament to help people by making their Universal\
            \ Credit payments more flexible. The regulations will give people claiming\
            \ Universal Credit in Scotland the choice of:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>being\
            \ paid Universal Credit twice a month rather than monthly; and</li> \n\
            \   <li>having their Universal Credit housing element being paid directly\
            \ to their landlords.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>These choices will be offered\
            \ to people making new claims for Universal Credit in full service areas\
            \ from 4 October 2017, during their Second Assessment Period, and for\

            \ policy development, non-regulatory options such as voluntary regulation\
            \ should always be considered and a BRIA completed to ensure the costs\

            \ \n  <h3 id=\"brias\">BRIAs</h3> \n  <p>Business and Regulatory Impact\
            \ Assessments (BRIAs) help to assess the likely costs, benefits and risks\
            \ of any proposed primary or secondary legislation, voluntary regulation,\
            \ codes of practice, or guidance that may have an impact on the public,\

            \ policy changes, even where they do not necessarily present additional\
            \ obvious burdens. In such cases it can either help confirm understanding\

          <p>As part of the commitments made in our plan: <a href="/publications/justice-scotland-vision-priorities/">Justice in Scotland: vision and priorities</a>, we are working with justice partners and other organisations to build on this, by:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><a href="/policies/victims-and-witnesses/victim-support-review/">reviewing current support for victims of crime</a>, including a single point of contact</li>

          <li><a href="/groups/appropriate-adults-working-group/">improving the communication support provided to help vulnerable witnesses and accused persons in the criminal justice system</a></li>
          <li>producing a <a href="/publications/victims-code-for-scotland/">Victimsâ Code for Scotland</a>, which clearly sets out the rights of victims in one place</li>
          <li>providing more than Â£4 million each year to support victimsâ organisations like <a href="https://www.victimsupportsco.org.uk/">Victim Support Scotland</a></li>

          <p>We use VAWG to refer to a range of actions that harm, or cause suffering and indignity to, women and children. These include but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>physical, sexual and psychological violence in the family, general community or institutions. This includes domestic abuse, rape, incest and child sexual abuse </li>
          <li>sexual harassment and intimidation at work and in public</li>
          <li>commercial sexual exploitation including prostitution, pornography and trafficking </li>
          <li>so called &#39;honour based&#39; violence, including dowry-related violence, female genital mutilation, forced and child marriages and &#39;honour&#39; crimes </li>
          </ul>
          <p>We believe that there are links between VAWG and inequality between men and women. The paper we produced in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA), <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2010/02/05102715/0">What does gender have to do with violence against women?</a>, explains our position.</p>

            \ account when sentencing offenders </li> \n   <li>give courts power to\

            \ over sexual offences committed against children to cover the other jurisdictions\
            \ of the United Kingdom.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The Act also makes provision\
            \ to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>create an offence of sharing private intimate\
            \ images without consent (commonly known as 'revenge porn') with a maximum\

            \ sexual harm </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>It is expected these provisions will\

            \ 2016 and 2017.</p> \n  <p>The approach includes:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>the\
            \ Men's Service, which lasts at least two years and includes preparation\
            \ and motivation sessions, a programme of 25 group work sessions and post-group\
            \ work</li> \n   <li>the Women's Service, which provides safety planning,\
            \ information, advice and emotional support to female partners and ex-partners.\
            \ It works with other services, like social work and the police, so that\
            \ they can give women and their families the support they need</li> \n\
            \   <li>the Children's Service, which makes sure that the needs of the\
            \ children whose parents are involved with the Caledonian System are met,\
            \ their rights upheld and the impact that domestic abuse has on their\
            \ lives is reduced</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>All the services are based on\

            \ possible harm to women and children. </p> \n  <p>The Caledonian Men's\
            \ Programme is currently undergoing a process of reaccreditation through\

            \ the intention to also accredit the Women's &amp; Children's Services\
            \ within the wider Caledonian System. SAPOR is an independent panel that\
            \ accredits offender interventions and programmes, and provides us (and\
            \ the Scottish Prison Service) with advice on rehabilitation processes.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>SAPOR recognised that it would be desirable to accredit\
            \ all elements of the Caledonian System at the same time so that all future\
            \ reaccreditation cycles will run concurrently. Work is being undertaken\
            \ at the moment to update all materials that support the Caledonian System.\
            \ </p> \n  <p>In December 2017 the Caledonian Men's Programme was reaccredited\
            \ through the Scottish Advisory Panel on Offender Rehabilitation (SAPOR),\
            \ with conditions. </p> \n  <p>The Women's and Children's Services which\
            \ make up the other elements of the Caledonian System were accredited\

            \ will expire on 6 December 2022.</p> \n  <p>The Caledonian System is\
            \ managed by Criminal Justice Services departments of local authorities\

          <p>We are expanding the range of opportunities available to young people by:</p>

          <li>building greater <a href="/policies/young-people-training-employment/school-college-employer-partnerships/">links between schools, colleges and businesses</a> by, for example, funding a network of regional employer groups</li>

          <p><a href="/publications/education-working-commission-developing-scotlands-young-workforce-final-report/">Education Working For All: a report by the Commission for Developing Scotland&#39;s Young Workforce</a> was published  in June 2014.

          <p>In response, we published our <a href="/publications/developing-young-workforce-scotlands-youth-employment-strategy/">Youth Employment Strategy: Developing the Young Workforce</a>, in December 2014. This accepted all recommendations in the Commission&#39;s report and set out how we planned to implement them.</p>

            \ Approach (WSA) is our programme for addressing the needs of young people\
            \ involved in offending. </p> \n  <p>It's underpinned by Getting it Right\
            \ for Every Child, which aims to ensure that support for children and\
            \ young people puts their â and their family's â needs first. </p> \n\
            \  <p>Practitioners need to work together to support families, and take\
            \ early action at the first signs of any difficulty. So they're not getting\
            \ involved after a situation has already reached crisis point.</p> \n\
            \  <p>WSA highlights the importance of different organisations and professions\
            \ working together to support children and young people. </p> \n  <p>It\
            \ offers tailored support and management based on individual needs, and\
            \ takes into account differing backgrounds and demographics. </p> \n \
            \ <p>This doesn't mean that crimes committed by children and young people\
            \ go unpunished. Children and young people can still be prosecuted if\
            \ the offence is serious enough to be dealt with at court or by the <a\
            \ href=\"childrens-hearings\">Children's Hearings System</a>.</p> \n \
            \ <p>Since 2011 the approach has provided a clear focus on the following\
            \ areas:</p> \n  <h3 id=\"early-and-effective-intervention\">Early and\
            \ effective intervention</h3> \n  <p>The police take a flexible approach\
            \ to offending by young people. This helps prevent future offending or\
            \ antisocial behaviour by providing timely and proportionate interventions,\
            \ and alerting other agencies to concerns about the child or young person's\
            \ behaviour and well-being. </p> \n  <h3 id=\"opportunities-to-divert-young-people-from-prosecution\"\
            >Opportunities to divert young people from prosecution</h3> \n  <p>Bringing\
            \ young people into the criminal justice system for low-level offences\
            \ often results in increased offending.</p> \n  <p>Offering alternatives\
            \ to formal prosecution can change young people's behaviour. This includes\
            \ programmes that provide support to change behaviour.</p> \n  <h3 id=\"\

            \ people out of the criminal justice system. We also want to improve the\

            \ \n  <p>Despite the increase to the minimum age of prosecution to 12\
            \ years in 2011, there have long been calls for the age of criminal responsibility\
            \ in Scotland to be raised. </p> \n  <p>These calls have come both from\
            \ the United Nations and children's organisations.</p> \n  <p>In November\
            \ 2015, we established an advisory group to consider the policy, legislative\
            \ and procedural implications of raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility\
            \ from 8 to 12 years. </p> \n  <p>The group took into account the implications\
            \ of change and developed proposals for consultation.</p> \n  <p>Following\
            \ this, we carried out a <a href=\"https://consult.scotland.gov.uk/youth-justice/minimum-age-of-criminal-responsibility/\"\
            >consultation exercise</a> looking for views on:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>whether\

            \ 2015, with support from the <a href=\"http://www.crer.org.uk/\">Coalition\
            \ for Racial Equality and Rights</a>, we engaged with a wide range of\

            \ themed visions and related goals set out in the framework have been\
            \ shaped by this involvement process. </p> \n  <p>The first of these visions\

            \ we aim to achieve by 2030, with the other visions covering a cross-section\
            \ of outcomes: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p>community cohesion and safety\
            \ â we build good race relations and community cohesion across all communities,\
            \ and all minority ethnic individuals feel safe, protected and included,\
            \ and experience less racism </p> </li> \n   <li><p>participation and\
            \ representation â minority ethnic participation and representation is\
            \ effective, fair, proportionate and valued at all levels of political,\
            \ community and public life </p> </li> \n   <li><p>education and lifelong\
            \ learning â everyone has the opportunity to learn in an inclusive and\
            \ cohesive environment without disadvantage in relation to racial inequality\
            \ or racism </p> </li> \n   <li><p>employability, employment and income\
            \ â minority ethnic people have equal, fair and proportionate access to\
            \ employment and representation at all levels, grades and occupation types\
            \ in Scotland's workforce, and experience fewer labour market, workplace\
            \ and income inequalities </p> </li> \n   <li><p>health and home â minority\
            \ ethnic communities in Scotland have equality in physical and mental\
            \ health as far as is achievable, have effective healthcare appropriate\
            \ for their needs and experience fewer inequalities in housing and home\
            \ life </p> </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>We will adopt a long-term, partnership-based\

          <p>In the census, 4,200 people identified themselves as &#39;White: Gypsy/Traveller&#39; (it is likely that some chose not to). Organisations that work with Gypsy/Travellers believe Scotland&#39;s community comprises 15,000 to 20,000 people. </p>

            \ prefer to live on private sites, which can help support their independence,\
            \ self-sufficiency and security. But they have often found it difficult\
            \ to access the planning system and get the appropriate permission to\
            \ develop their own sites. </p> \n  <p>Making provision for the development\

            \ lifestyle. </p> \n  <p>And approval of more Gypsy/Traveller sites, which\
            \ are sound in planning terms, could also ease accommodation pressures\
            \ for the community as a whole, and potentially reduce the number of unauthorised\
            \ encampments. </p> \n  <p>The Scottish Government funded a project by\
            \ PAS (formerly Planning Aid Scotland) to increase awareness of the needs\
            \ of Gypsy/Travellers in accessing the planning system. </p> \n  <p>It\

            >five planning guides regarding Gypsy/Travellers and the planning system</a>.\
            \ They were published in April 2015 and aimed at Gypsy/Travellers, planning\
            \ professionals, elected members, community councillors and the media.\
            \ </p> \n  <p><a href=\"/publications/scottish-planning-policy/\">Scottish\
            \ Planning Policy (SPP)</a> was published in 2014. It requires councils\

            \ and to involve the community in planning and decision-making which affects\
            \ them. </p> \n  <p>Scottish Ministers have made it clear that they want\
